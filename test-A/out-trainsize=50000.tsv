the authorities know about a quarter of a year illegal advertising , it cannot be . 
we accept , completely ’ irrational zeal . 
for a quarter of a year redakce online the newspaper aktuálně.cz by the story billboardu in the southern čechách , which now attracting motoristy to visit lipna , where it is not only turisticky interesting procházka in korunách trees , but also the olympic fleet . 
správci highways know that there is off the books , but argue that the nothing nezmůžou . 
such reklam are across the country , perhaps hundreds of thousands of . 
according to the officials is to blame chatrný law , which is not possible because of illegal mobile billboardy now removed . 
what is needed is napřed complex bureaucratic kolečko . 
meanwhile , to name but a company and office is a short on it . 
or consider promoted to take a few meter and bureaucratic process must begin znova . 
ředitelství roads and highways before a quarter of a year ago přiznalo : in the tahu of českých budějovic on lipno stands on our pozemku on the road advertising billboard off the books . 
even three months but officials was not enough to prevent it from illegal přenosné framework with the massive inzertním plakátem . 
as would be nevadilo , that is , in addition to vozovky in padesátimetrovém ochranném band , where the state must security for nothing . 
správci roads , argues that , with the billboardem děravému of law cannot simply to . 
it needs to deal and odvézt down . 
this " , we must not only so afford , " he says , ředitelství road and highways nina ledvinová and odkazuje on the complex , that removing bureaucratic kolečko billboardu must precede , according to the rule of law . 
the case of this particular billboardu , which began to the fate of online aktuálně.cz detailně to see the spring , meanwhile , is unique and illustrates the overall problem , which can be solved quickly and effectively , and the authorities . 
only in the southern čechách redakce napočítala dozens of mobile reklam located against the rules , in addition to vozovky or in its close . 
similarly , and others are on the badlands of . 
" we have difficulty force companies to eliminate poutače , " supported by the head of transportation odboru českobudějovického krajského office jiří klása , whose colleagues such stories addressed . 
according to the klásy is to blame děravý act , which is constrained by bureaucrats . 
napřed must address billboardu složitě owners to be promoted down . 
but corporate executives are often nedostižní or know fintu , which has already aktuálně.cz popisovalo in the past , when the issue began to be interested detailněji : only mobile stojan with an advertisement move a few meter and officials can previous challenge to the black inzerce put to the basket . 
this is because the must precisely to determine which is illegal billboard . 
" if it someone posune and souřadnice suddenly disagree , nahlíží on this as the new equipment , and we must owners oslovit again , " explains jiří klása . 
a new law help . 
change could bring a new law that since september forbidding for the next year billboardy highways and reduce is even on the road i. classes . 
critics pointed out that the rules of the fighting for illegal and easily přenositelných reklam remain the same as now . 
and the authorities are so neuleví . 
companies and can continue to pronájmech illegal ground make money to dozens of hundreds of millions of korun per year , and no one of them can . 
for example , billboard lákající to include lipno society commerz billboard . 
officials it well known : českobudějovický magistrát with it , now leads the three board for the top management off the books billboardy . 
in any firm risk management třísettisícová pokuta . 
it is a more reklam , which were without permission umístěny in ochranném band roads i. class . 
management have not ukončena is jaroslav mráz , the head of the odboru transportation českobudějovického magistrátu . 
it is being aktuálně.cz zajímá , while between these cases even be outside soon to them , but most likely přibude . 
according to the spokesperson řsd niny ledvinové firm nereagovala on repeated písemné challenges to the case , and it will be on the table krajským and then probably magistrátním officials . 
the company commerz billboard belongs to those suspect companies that fail kontaktovat . 
nepřebírá poštu and official headquarters in žižkově lift from more than six years ago . 
it is not clear , who for it is . 
in the past pošta firms chodila to jihočeskému podnikateli antonu fischerovi , which was ostrým dispute , the head of českého brands hyundai . 
fischer , whose society billboard of the euro , from comerz billboard pronajímá and offers is inzerentům , but in the past reject any connection . 
meanwhile , this spring , when řsd began to spur aktuálně.cz show promoted by the lipno , he has state officials to send a letter for tajemnou society commerz billboard into its penzionu , reportedly a firm located . 
neither of the adresy , no one správcům highways still neozval .

since last december , we have closed the prisons 20 mosques , and modliteben . 
and others will follow , announced the interior minister .

this should make sermons was in conformity with democracy . 
radical mosques zavřeme . 
at the same time , the french government is in the campaign against radikálům . 
and , more recently announced , will follow the interior minister . 
in france , there is no place for those who in mešitách says hatred and respected some of the principles of our country , like equality between men and women .

suddenly , it looked as if the turks could for everything . 
was more serious charge from vrcholných government officials about the erdoğan ’ s own family should benefit from ilegálního trade with oil in parts of syria controlled the so-called islamic state . 
the this powerfully denied . 
but in petrohradě came the message that it is time to shall continue . 
ultimately , this meeting took place just because the putin ’ s excuse was that since president erdogana asked . 
russia could jakés takés declare victory . 
to declare a truce ankaru benefits are clear . 
in the first place was erdoğan was during the last month nezdařeného coup almost deprived of power , and therefore needs all of their friends . 
repeated terrorist attacks in turkey the visibly also rocked . 
there is also the economic incentives . 
russian sanctions should domestic impact , above all , lifting of the flight charterových that each year přepraví several million tourists , russian coast to turkey . 
the number of has declined by almost 90 % . 
when it comes to russia , tour operátoři and charterové society here , surely oddechnou , or when it comes to restore flights . 
to make the mediterranean cestovním tourism in the late sezóny . 
even this week of the national television accepted , promised a cheaper fruits and vegetables , and will again imports of agricultural commodities of turkey ’ s allowed for purposes such as improving . 
“ there tourists , tomatoes back around , ” as it hlásala in newspapers report vedemosti . 
but a visit should moskvu for another political value . 
ankara , to the west zlobí for what is weak in response to a coup attempt . 
besides , of insiders lengthy talks on the entry into the eu and the putin - which eager to insistence that could use ochlazení and přetrhat for turkey with the west . 
russia ’ s leader entirely sure gained bonusové points , when it ankara asked for help zvolených agencies for a coup attempt to . 
you must understand that for moskvu , which is deeply rooted fear of the regime change , this is a . 
so the summit in this pompézním beach paláci , russia , and turkey to showcase what i one of analysts described as “ alliance disparate ” : how to share the forces of the two countries that they feel , be odmítnuty and used the west . 
but , despite the fact that have publicly mutual reconciliation between the two countries are major differences . 
the first is syria , where the moscow to build a more recently , the role of the peacemaker , but where russia and turkey is on the opposite sides . 
could be said that , after almost tříhodinových early talks both presidents to press conference , said that , on the issue , or nezmínili . 
the turkish president , deliberately vyhl answer to the question about the difference between them , while putin has decided to these differences vyzdvihnout . 
there is no clear agreement on the basis of which would both countries might find common ground on syria . 
but after months of an open hostility - and , given the risk of total disaster , when a member of nato turki terhadap pesawat perang rusia di russian bojový letoun - is certainly better , and that both leaders talk at least once again .

russia ’ s president putin propustil head of the presidential staff sergeje ivanova 
russian president vladimir putin in pátek unexpectedly propustil sergeje ivanova from as a presidential administration . 
ivanov was one of the closest putin ’ s associates for many years .

in the declaration of the kremlin ’ s stresses that putin “ ivanova unleashed from his services of russia ’ s presidential administration , ” but not restored reason . 
instead of his take over anton vajno , who was ivanovovým representative since 2012 .

in the appointment of putin ’ s said : “ děkuji you for your confidence . ” 
i believe that the most important role administration is supporting your activities heads of state in terms of the bill laws and control of the extent to which they are dodržovány your instructions . 
putin in pátek russian tv station said that it ivanov requested the ease of as and recommended to replace it is vajno .

the kremlin are at sites citovány yang putin ’ s remarks , in which ivanov reports : “ it is true that in 2012 , i you over the course of a conversation asked me to this very challenging the post , even could be said problematic , the post svěřil to four years . 
it seems , i was leader of the presidential staff four years and eight months . 
ivanov , as took in december 2011 . 
before took a místopředsedy governments and secretary of defense . 
it is a member of the russian security council , and the previously , like putin , working for national security committee ( the kgb ) . 
in the late 1990 ’ s , when putin command a federal of the russian federation fsb security service ( ) to replace the kgb ivanov , was appointed his representative . 
when putin came to power , has appointed a ivanova one of its closest five associates . 
their time , even much speculation about about that would ivanov could become nástupcem putin in the state after his second term , because the third term for putin would be protiústavní . 
but the post ’ other middle putin ’ s spolupracovník dmitri medvedev . 
putin is a return to the presidency of only three and half a year later became prime minister .

michael martin , leading project forth crossing bridge constructors , he said , “ in the first uzávěra stavbě each mostu is always a milestone an important .

this we did protažením northern přibližovacího viaduktu 700 millimeters southern direction . 
this was the massive and at the same time , a very delikátní operations . 
a massive because viadukt is long 222 meter , linked about 6 dan tons and was needed to drive the stoupáním about 3 % . 
delikátní because of tolerance faced a team of working , were very small , only a few millimeters every direction . 
fortunately , all of this was very well .

she refuses to address the case for tluchořově american-born wife . 
petr tluchoř is one of the three mps , who should be given to the charges from nečase prime minister and his cabinet , šéfky jany nagyové political trafiku , so lucrative post for political retreat . 
in 2012 , it was about a tax package . 
šnajdr , fuksa tluchoř have allowed him and his rezignacemi . 
then , in the influential levels in the state-owned companies . 
and , therefore , were also suspicion of úplatku and skončili month in jail . 
but , according to the court neoprávněně nowadays , and so compensation almost a 2 million korun . 
now , in the case of tluchoř acting as svědek , after the supreme court . 
his wife is working in the market and building on the ovocném addresses the civilian disputes . 
yet to be she helena králová opatrná ( addresses trestněprávní affairs - pozn. red. ) , and avoid a possible námitkám . 
the case , it probably will caring for other pražský judicial district . 
králová is already twice zprostila blame janu nečasovou , before nagyovou . 
this was supposed to the abuse of military intelligence to watch the first prime minister wife nečase radky . 
in this case tluchoř nefiguroval . 
according to the právníka jaroslava ortmana is but a unnecessarily excessive response . 
i think that nestrannost cannot be such vykládána to rule out the court , if svědkové wife have or related to the court . 
i doubt that would then be was on the newspaper noted , for nothing . 
" strikes me that ulítlé , " added . 
in the case of political trafik accused is also roman boček , the former . 
according to the attorney who his the great 's tomana , but any point had a chance to succeed . 
the threshold for obvodní 1 projednával 13 , block the indictment šéfky cabinet the great 's former prime minister nečase jany nagyové ( now nečasové ) , and other implicated in the case of military intelligence . 
the snímku comes with nečasová manželem to court . 
tluchořová should deal with talk peroutkovi . 
the wife exposlance should , for example , on statements president miloše zemana of democratic prewar journalists ferdinandu peroutkovi . 
zeman to it , saying that sympatizoval with adolf hitler . 
one of the školaček is already dead ! 
perhaps the girl zahynula in leteckém náletu allied forces . 
in syria , together with two as the old přítelkyněmi odletěla last year in february of london airports gatwick . 
the ministry of interior report on its death nekomentovalo . 
the young londýňanky that utekly from home , were , according to the police secretly převezeny in syria , despite turkey ’ s border . 
shamima begumová , amira abaseová and kadiza sultanaová zamířily by the media for their other former spolužačkou from the london school bethnal green academy . 
the case of the last year , has a huge wave of attention and also tensions in relations between the uk and turkey . 
the uk ’ s security forces estimate that in syria has odcestovalo around 600 british muslims , of what about 50 young women and girls . 
many of them joined radikálům from is and other groups . 
those who have returned home , account for the uk terrorist threat . 
work for dreams stotisícový salary . 
well paying job , to which or nepotřebujete high school . 
so looks at first glance ajťáka work . 
and often in the second . 
the advantage is not only on the conditions extremely high salary ( in prague , it to work in vyděláte 180 dan kč ) , but also extreme benefits . 
the reason is a lack of information technology specialists . 
lack of specialists . 
an estimated is in the czech republic almost 20,000 it specialists . 
according to the statistics are between nejhledanější personnel agencies grafton programmers , vývojáři network , engineers , and aplikační осы . 
they can choose candidates among the few nabídkami work . 
so nesoupeří candidates for labor position , but labor position on the candidates , komentuje jitka součková , marketingová manažerka grafton recruitment . 
high school is unnecessary . 
vysokoškolské education is not for ajťáky imperative . 
vysokoškolské education is a good basis , and is determinant of a country ’ s overall intelligence and vzdělatelnosti candidate , but often does not have the power to do the development of knowledge . 
vývojáři , they must constantly to new things , which one vystudovaná high school replace is petr kubačka , director monster career cz . 
the most pays in prague . 
wages ajťáků everywhere , running well above republikovým average . 
for most of the money to come in prague , and brně in regions that have such hitparáda is not . 
" wage conditions in brně are similar to those pražskými , " confirms kubačka . 
on the top výdělek reach techničtí executives . 
in prague , and brně may come to the 120 dan - 180 dan kč . 
in other regions is salary of lower , but not there neklesne under 80,000 kč . 
it is also poptávaní projektoví managers . 
in the they can profit 60,000 - 100,000 kč . 
it is also a fight absolventy . 
while in some occupations often must absolventi vyrazit equal to the work for ajťáků , this is not true . 
if the firms and přetáhnout přeplatit expert from other companies to begin to absolventovi . 
they can take it a vychovat under its . 
without language will require . 
the language of cizího suited in every profession , but it is necessary for ajťáků minimally decent english . 
knowledge of at least one cizího language for some positions , it is imperative . 
on the other hand , one encounters cases , when firms are particularly expert educated and zkušeného person and spokojí only with average knowledge angličtiny . 
but if , for example , the worker support controls more foreign talking , for his employer is an interesting , because it will be able to service their customers more from various countries , providing director kubačka .

pokémon go - honba for health , happiness , which is worth 
as is to see how the world is changing . 
many people in the last decade lamentuje that teenageři and children have already nehrají outsiders , preferring trávení free time before obrazovkami . 
pokémon go zvedá people from pohovek and leads to activity . 
time spent before obrazovkami was originally smrskl on tv later in the video game , and , most recently , a smart phones . 
it is great to see that technology and activities outsiders , nevzájem nevylučují . 
of course , a mluvím vogue , which is pokémon go , based on the use of postavičkách that first emerged in the video games in the late 1990 ’ s ( later the playing field cards kreslený seriál , and other ) . 
as with many cultural fenoménů , and there has been a uvedením this new game at the beginning of july in the us , australia , and new zealand to the decline in interest . 
launch in other countries , was odloženo because of the massive uptake of that led to the web sites . 
pokémon go it in a few days more than tinder users and almost as many users , as has twitter . 
how it works ? 
in krátkosti , players on chytrém phone go out to find pokémony , which are watching with gps , and when it can find it is “ vyfotit ” ( more than screenshot on the telephone ) , or so “ . ” 
that is gripping manias generation , moreover , at younger ages game , it has been zvedá it from sedaček and driving out to find pokémony . 
in the us , thanks to this game came to a significant increase in the number of steps that “ ” every day , the average person does .

society has information about who go pokémon plays - see only a data about the exercises levels . 
many of the public campaign seeking to the people “ a 30 , ” “ zvedli from gauče ” and “ were active every day ” has been made on neúrodnou land , because most message aimed at public health is nudná and určená people who look well . 
yet the importance of the exercises , must not be podceňována . 
those who cvičí regularly , reduce the risk of disease , cancer , or depresemi . 
physical activity , accounts for the control of hmotnosti , high krevního pressure , diabetes , and a long list of the benefits , which there cannot be the . 
but the game go krása pokémon lies in this that people go out , and do something has been celebrating . 
so pokrýváte three pillars of health - movement , hold out fresh air and rays . and entertainment . 
some people , even in honbě pokémony for a new friends . 
, as it is , of course , there are even some nudní patroni , who are seeking to prevent any záminku , could stěžovat . 
and , yes , can anyone vejít into the door . 
and what , as ? 
it is a breakthrough . 
in its time for the use of smart phones , such as fitbit , uměly follow our activity , but we nedávaly reason to do anything to did , as is the case for téhle game . 
okouká interest in the news , and it will at some point the opadat . 
but the success of the pokémonů , there will be other games that will use virtual reality , and combining with aktivitou in the real world , and the will of the people in honbě for aktivitou , health , and better form .

simone bilesová ( the us ) , and vlevo aly raismanová objímají , after the gold and stříbrné medaile in finále ženského víceboje jednotlivkyň in the summer the olympic games in 2016 brazil 's rio de janeiro in čtvrtek . 
the first bilesová úterý , when it was a vykřičník in celebration outgoing national týmové koordinátorky marthy karolyiové . 
bilesová insists that in their a long way to the top of never nedívala forward , which , but it is not so is true . 
part of its sestavy in prostných - the , which contains for it typical trojité salto with dvojitým pada - is zasazena into latin to music , which would be very hodila home to the streets outside olympijskou arény in rio . 
this is not náhoda . 
dívku adoptovali its grandparents as batole talents and her mother had trenérky aimee boormanové way to tělocvičny , where boormanová trénovala and where it on the ground . 
competition in víceboji neprohrála from the summer of 2013 , it is sled victory , that can continue as long as bilesová would want to . 
even when mustafinová krátko to take the lead to two otočkám , it was only illusions . 
kladina prostné - and where bilesová has the world ’ s šampionát - are . 
has the back to lead to 15,433 points for kladinu - and complete with 15,933 points in prostných . 
it raismanová jemně objala when expected to finálové score - the formalitu - and around třpytivě červených , white , and modrých stínů bilesové , there have been slzy when with thinking that , once a small zapsala into deníčku . 
the performance of the raismanové was a bit odplatou for four years before the olympics , when the third dělila place with mustafinovou , then it but bronz because of the cost of three top sestav . 
this time dvaadvacetiletá kapitánka team that americans say “ babča , ” was a enough vpředu . 
after their prostných posílala polibky pie in the crowd , zdolána return , which is sometimes an uncertain . 
for bilesovou contribution is that this devatenáctiletá atletka this week conducted on twitter , where he became a hitem , a completely new significance :

why we need simone , and gabby laurie 
this is the takhle představuji ženský team gymnastek for this year , the olympic games , and not just for several reasons . 
first , i was in the summer of any olympiádě sejak tahun 1984 , and the us have never as dominant . 
second , in its team tomhle are three gymnastky , simone bilesová , gabby douglasová lauren ” and “ laurie hernandezová that inspired so many young barevných girls . 
everyone is proud of the composition of the team that doplňuje aly raismanová , which is the jewish origin , and katolička madison kocianová . 
finally , there is a team that looks like america . 
it also upevnil černošek and latinskoameričanek on top of sport . 
one gymnastkou figure in the last four years was afroameričanka . 
simone and gabby were last year , the first and second bottom . 
this means something . 
in the last olympiádě gabby dougalsová surprisingly šampionkou has become the olympic games , and america jásala . 
now the world could be saw the incredible performance of the world ’ s trojnásobné vítězky simone bilesové , and douglasové laurie hernandezové that předvedly neočekávané , but mistrné gymnastické figury . 
in the čtvrtek simone has become the fourth američankou that , gold in ženském víceboji individuals . 
and členka team aly raismanová , silver . 
we are witnessing sportovního height , but in hours gymnastiky it faced in the country . 
simone , and gabby laurie absolvovaly olympic team in the same way as aly madison and . 
are “ finálovou pětkou , ” because team gymnastek on the olympic games složen will only of the four atletek , and this is the last year , when marta karolyiová trénuje . 
but reality is such that gymnastika is financially challenging sport and gymnastky trénují mainly in private gymnastických klubech that keep parents who pays the cost of tréninky , equipment , roads , dresy , fees competition , hotelové accommodation ( for trenéry and svěřence and their families . ) , and it is far from this . 
most of these sports klubů is rich in areas in the suburbs of activity that can support . 
in these klubech have gymnasté all tréninky and for families gymnastek and gymnastů , it is the expensive and long commitment . 
aimee boormanová , trenérka simone bilesové , and maggie haneyová , trenérka laurie hernandezové , both trénovaly atlety at a time when began in gymnastice . 
indeed , it is our duty to tréninky gymnastiky , which are more affordable and accessible communities countless young girls , and that simone gabby laurie inspired . 
i established gymnastiku foundation for 20 years ago . 
in my organizations , where nabízíme gymnastiku for free , or with low cost in harlemu for more than 15 dan young people in the cities ( especially of black and hispánského origin ) , and we trénovali national and international champions . 
in september , we will expandovat to detroit ( my native cities ) , where we provide high-quality gymnastiku young people , who deserve to be taught and benefit from the great olympic sport . 
gymnastika nurtures force flexibility and coordination bodies hard work and discipline , and commitment mind . 
this means the combination of life benefits for good health , successes in school , and in the work . 
it is this týmem inspiration to thousands of us will send young girls that they want to do gymnastiku . this is great . 
participation in the sport is very important , especially for girls . 
it is very exciting time . 
děkuji you , simone , aly , laurie , gabby madison and , for that you have “ girls ’ power ” and vyhrály you olympic týmové gold . and děkuji you for motivujete so many young girls all původů to gave way to a healthy , strong and úspěšnými young women . 
after zamítnutí proposal jeremyho hunta young doctors are prepared to enter into other stávek 
ministers hoped that , after a overworked treaty , the british medical association ( bma ) comes to an end to friction over change . but 58 % of the 37 dan young doctors , who zúčastnili election , rejected the treaty . 
hunt in july revealed plans to enforcing the agreement with the by hns was in the country , ” and “ no one another delay should damaging impact on workers and patients . 
the first young doctors have signed a new treaty , which includes changes in the midnight and víkendových of practices , with the goal of improving care in nesociálních hours . 
lékařka ellen mccourtová minister , the commission bma for young doctors in statements minulou night put it : “ young doctors still have a serious concern about the proposed contracts , particularly in the sense that there would be to increase in the current crisis , labor , and thus to férovému treatment of all doctors . ” 
only eight weeks before the first group of doctors krisis under a new treaty , is needed to progress and time is running out . 
bma efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have unwillingness to engage with , and often with ohlušujícím tichem by governments . 
and , despite its promise of jeremyho hunta of last month ’ s that this option is open . 
“ jeremy hunt now need to act , force to enforcing and address concerns of young doctors . ” 
if this will not happen , then are young doctors are ready to make the next steps . 
during the last strike at the end of april came to a postponement of the almost 13 dan rutinních operations and 100,000 visits , because sisters and осы were povoláni to zastoupili doctors , who were between protestujícími . 
ministers hoped that , after a overworked treaty , the british medical association ( bma ) will be to the conflicts affecting over change . 
bma wants to pay for higher work on víkend bagi 54 dan young doctors , who would have been a source of contracts . 
daniel mortimer , the chairman of the employers ’ hns , has called the young doctors to any strike nevstupovali . 
mortimer said : “ oborovou action to achieve only little or nothing , but a pressure to make overburdened teams and services , and will rise to fears of running out of stuff and for patients and their families , ošetřující staff . ” 
in the past two months we acted with a young doctors and , together with by the health care , and other we have a positive reacted to the them concern about the role of oversight and informátora . 
employers hoped that the positive involvement in other important issues , such as vytížení , flexibility in školeních , another training for those who are cutting back after career , the cost of training , mutual recognition objects , and study in platech time off work because the difference between the sexes - was proof of how seriously employers , health , education , and health ministry of england take agreement , which were with bma dosaženy in november , and february may . 
a cure for sixty korun on the day can reduce the danger infarktu 
thousands of patients yang infarktem will be able to take a cure that is in terms of around 60 korun ( two pound . ) , the authorities podávat recommend it more patients for a longer period of time . 
the against srážení blood ticagrelor reduces for people with heart disease , to a danger that it will happen again . 
now , after the prodělání infarktu podává over the next 12 months to reduce the danger of a strokes or another . 
hns watchdog nice recommends to be a cure people podáván for four years , to reduce further the danger cardiovascular problems . 
but now hns watchdog nice recommends to be podáván people for four years , to reduce further the danger cardiovascular problems . 
in england infarktem suffer each year about $ 140 1,000 people and a quarter of them even further hamper záchvat or heart strokes . 
infarkt and strokes are způsobovány nahromaděním fat , which creates stěnách arterií souvislou class . 
when it comes to secede classes , this may be to create a blood sraženiny , block access to the heart of blood and srdečního infarktu . 
if sraženina clear , heightened blood řečištěm can continue to block , přívod blood into the brain and cause the physical brain mrtvici . 
people , who already infarkt to lose , are exposed to higher risk of a . 
ticagrelor , the company that produces astrazeneca , and that is prodáván under trade , brilique , reducing the risk by to the sraženin is less pravděpodobněji . 
the proposed directive nice , who was now uveřejněn , it recommends to patients 90 years mg ticagreloru over the next 12 months and , together with 60 mg aspirinem , and it twice a day for other three years . 
professor carole longsonová , managing director center for a new technologies for health nice , she said : “ precautionary secondary , despite the availability of effective treatment , there is a quarter of patients who should infarkt and that further hamper heart záchvat or strokes , often with devastujícími consequences . ” 
fear of a repeat of can have a negative impact on the quality of life for the patient . 
it is well established that ticagrelor , combined with aspirinem is effective in reducing the danger of other heart záchvatů and strokes in humans , which has already infarkt caught . 
is the us potěšením that in the předběžném recommendations ticagreloru can expand the possibility of treatment , which are available , many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it . 
because the information about the efficacy and safety ticagreloru - all of the danger krvácení - beyond the three years are limited , is not in the proposed treatment of this time doporučena .

the uk ’ s cestovatel , decided to the objective of heavy test its immune systems and dávivý reflex - olizováním those nejšpinavějších and nejnechutnějších jobs in europe .

the idea olíznout button splachovače in train wreck that were used thousands of other people , it may seem to be utterly odpudivý , but in kuchyňském dřezu is actually much more malicious bacteria . 
ian wright during his entire way for europe spoke with doctors and specialists in strengthening health care about bacteria střevních flóry and of their own health . 
fortunately , none of what olízl , it in the mouths nezanechalo nothing worse than pachuť . 
ian wright proslavil testováním the resilience of their střev at around the world , and cestách pojídáním podivných and úžasných affairs . 
during the téhle mission completely safely its immune systems tested - from the public to zábradlí vlakových stanicích after splachovadlo 
in the movie that about natočil , said : “ i have since childhood for their health and nestaral power to pusy , i gave everything from hlíny after pojídání červů and bahnité water . ” 
in the movie its reputation are upheld . 
all that rejected , were dirty public záchodky in russia . 
after jednoduchém stěru luminometr showed the value of more than 4,000 forces . 
for comparison , the newly umyté hands should have less than 60 . 
one public záchodek in russia , but olíznout refused to the what his luminometr showed more than 4,000 troops , while the umyté hands are less than 60 
ian wright and finnish manufacturer dairy valio natočili cestovatelův film called the lickhiker , with a guide inner strength , shows that the bacteria for different places , such as the koupelně 
in the movie said : “ that it is almost nejhnusnější what i when the záchodě felt . ” 
nothing špinavějšího than that there is no ! 
olizovat nebudu nothing , because it is there nechutné . 
the film lickhiker , with a guide inner strength was natočen , in cooperation with finským 's largest manufacturer dairy valio . 
the company panu wrightovi provided the drug valio gefilus , which contains bakteri mléčné kyseliny and vitamíny c and d for people that helps strengthen střevní bacteria and immune systems .

something that should be pursued bent and at the same time , the us to explain probiotik benefits . 
we bláznivých invented a lot of ideas , the idea that ended “ zavolejme ianovi . ” 
it is said that concern about the health střev becomes a global phenomenon . 
instead , to only about mluvili products , we want them to be given to the broad souvislostí - good and bad bakteri in our daily environment , the importance of health střev and how it is propojeno with immune systems system . 
rising interest in a healthy střeva is a global phenomenon , and we documentary consumers through the way they consider podrobnější information .

where is headed vinyl : who really buying gramofonové desky ? 
vinyl milují osamocení men in the middle age . 
than rozhodnete sekci commentaries zahltit peprnými echoing comments by under pseudonymem nevšichniosamělímuživestřednímvěku , podotýkáme that the ruling stems from the real data . 
according to the yougov is so much diskutované resurrection gramofonových desek associated with the boom , not mileniálů who want to kochat originalitou endowment effect of physical předmětu , but with nostalgia middle age . 
those who have recently have album on vinylu are nejpravděpodobněji people in their between and 54 45 years . 
young people in the age of 18-24 are at least likely . 
indeed , it is not the accumulation of nadšeného fanouška - all this is the emotional dimension : the elderly people who buying gramofonové desky pravděpodobněji , they want to hold onto their feelings ( 56 % versus 53 % ) , and are themselves ( like to 69 % versus 66 % ) . 
but are the results yougov right ? 
if this was an odvysílán as television report , i watched would kamera how vyrážím rušné into the streets in soho , oblečen into decentního šedého obleku widely , and gestikuluji . then i stopped , has lifted hand , he said something autoritativního , as : “ it is on this pojďme to see . ” 
so , in this pojďme to see . 
while the heart of soho slowly vytrácí his – and kouzlo buildings - once obsazené independent buyers , are now zaplněny hotels , and restauracemi jídelnami , and konfekcí kancelářskými needs , several fantastických specialized trades with gramofonovými deskami still remain . 
i would be asked to kameru for a while stopped natáčet . i postavím close to different men in these and , given that pokusím vypozorovat , what is the age of their and emotional rozpoložení . 
stuart ( 55 ) , rodák of glasgowa , which i from sister ( ray : the two young men , women , three middle age ) to reckless records ( jumlah : eight men middle age , one woman around 20 ) has in london meeting odpoledne and prohlíží , and to secret order hours time . 
ptám , whether it is sběratel . 
i think i “ yes , ” he says . 
i have about 3 or 4 thousands of nahrávek . 
all those nahrávky lemují stěny obýváku - a picture of the ideal of his own photo nahoře ( i sent e-mailem nesledoval , i him to home ) . 
this huge amounts of alb and singlů has also because that it can afford : can do now to buy gramofonové desky that could not afford , when determined originally , and again , buying what sold in the past , and have no vindru . 
“ a lot of what the kupuji , is in the late 1960 ’ s , and in the early 1970 ’ s . they are things that would be issued , when i was 11 or 12 . when i was a small and could not power , is pořídit , ” he says . 
agrees with by those who nahrávky to buy , they are likely to be introverti what they have to society itself ourselves . and providing : “ nekouřím and or nepiji power . 
this is a sin . 
wez 25 ( ray ) works in sister , and also think that many consumers , faced with setkává , zapadá into of yougov . 
všiml , too , a new influx of people ovlivněných media wave . people who a comeback slyšeli and felt compelled to buy their old gramofonové desky back . 
according to my talks with those of their sbírek zbavovali frequently among the years of 1998 , and 1999 . 
consumers , one who sell their gramofonové desky and nakupovali cdčka , now the cd to sell their their gramofonové desky buyers back , ” he says . 
this might explain some boom milovníků gramofonových desek age . 
but what alleged emotional importance gramofonových desek ? 
nezabere is more than a few seconds , to in trade as phonica found in given that with hudbou naleznete pleasant community people with similar sentiment . 
according to the weze some older consumers are particularly pohoršeni system bezkontaktních payments . 
some hawks gramofonových desek may feel zahlceni digitálním in the world , and they chose to known environment obalů gramofonových desek , things do memories of the peaceful dospívání . 
“ i think , filling in the gaps , or something may pose a endowment effect material comfort , ” says wez . 
i sběratel itself , for me , this is so , and i think that in a lot of people , too . 
this is easy way to fill rather than on . 
“ we all as their social workers ! ” can be the spolupracovník from hromady gramofonových desek . 
survey of companies icm in april found that nearly 50 % of the people who have a month before have vinylové album , is it even neposlechlo . 
menurut penelitian has 41 % of gramofon , who never not used , while 7 % of those what buying gramofonové desky , gramofon does not . 
in a report tomhle was probably vypadal seriously znepokojený in procházení hromádky compilací bossa nova . 
aspect of “ trofeje ” and the concern is something that the všiml jonny ( 42 ) that works in sounds of the universe ( : the number of three men middle age ) . 
“ someone recently came and said : “ i have even gramofon , but chci to buy on board radiohead , we could do it to the poličce , ” povídá . ” 
the percentage of such , but there is not much to do so . 
it is more than a produktovou aspect of music . 
go to the us , the people who say : “ i have gramofon . ” 
these are the young people , not those older , odrostlí puberťáci , who is to get it . 
fopp , which is currently almost the entire one patro gramofonovým deskám , has been in on my coming much různorodější surprises visitors . 
there are couples sedmdesátníků , tourists , what do fotky puberťáci , and women in the middle age . 
while a loose , given that it is not so much as before - of reproduktorů , instead of tahavého jazzu can be the popular from wild beasts full syntezátorů and sex is good to variable customers . 
none of them faced is not particularly alone , but vtíravé mental trauma to odhadnete when , in addition to someone stojíte 30 seconds . 
elanora ) , several ( 27 minutes in fopp is different , and prohlíží gramofonové desky in slevě . 
it is one of those who prohlíží costs , rather than to horečně spent . 
according to the power of their words nevydělává , so nepřipadá considered that would gramofonové desky sbírala . 
this is a lot of money . 
it is easy to listen to music , computers or . but gramofonové desky have their kouzlo ... ” povzdychne , toužebně . 
neumím to explain - it is unique .

it is no surprise that the demographic area where is pravděpodobněji more time and money than in other areas , it is also ahead , where most spends for nejluxusnější goods , how vinyl is certainly . 
but while according to my lesson , it seems that the results are yougov accurate - at least in gramofonovými deskami nezohledňují , given that with large quantities of sběratelek and milovníků vinylu , who are in fact , given that with gramofonovými deskami and the online fórech .

the court in france rejected the authorities in calais to demolici dozens of provizorních stores and restaurací in táboře džungle , where they live thousands of refugees .

the humanitarian in court uvedly stores and restaurant , that are vital for free , and that food , which is supported by the state association and other groups , they amendment food for growing numbers of refugees in táboře . 
disputed provizorní stores and restaurant often provides shelter and food for free , those in need . 
the court in lille decided that there is no legal basis , which would people zabraňoval 72 provizorních trades do , but argued that the “ prefekta calais are entirely understandable . ” 
a jean-françois molla said that shops food , coffee shops and restaurant are much more than just when the role of food , “ the people who live in conditions of extremely zoufalých . ” 
he said that they provide prostory klidná jobs to the meeting of refugees and volunteers . 
one of the jobs , which threatened demolice was kavárna in táboře , jungle book kids , which is nezisková organizations , and that offers 200 hours per day , food , and angličtiny francouzštiny and been advice to hundreds of nezletilých people without a in táboře .

what from ústí očekáváte ? 
těším , it seems , most kluků band well known . 
i zvědavý on two other foreigners who come . 
perhaps the sedneme lidsky to us this together pasovalo . 
zvednete ústí ? 
should the reputation otloukánka , but any sezona is different . 
brno two years ago , osmé , now ii ended . 
in ústí is a new team , only a few players .

a team that will fight , which is my positions . 
i likes to bojuju , likes to hecuju , and the opportunity to dostávám not so špičkovém team . 
i was two years in příbrami ústí , but it is greater challenge than be immediately in šestém team , because it starts from spodku . 
you outsiders , he noted in ústí already trénuje australan boehm . 
as it ? 
i it chance , known to univerziádě we played against each other in the group . 
and we párkrát , there are bavili , sometimes we sat together night after zápasech , so that we have already , and kamarádsky .

the american , i wrote , looks like the fajn kluk , brazilec knows how will be english .

this připadalo me as a good idea . 
i nahrávač , so the , who make up , so i had all communicate . 
now i see what it is a finds players , i am on the internet , as a , i saw things videos . 
the whole jevil in pohodě , kluk skáče , is high . 
the facebook are we wrote a few reports , seemed like vtipálek , zapadne to the us . 
as těšíte position on nahrávačské jedničky ? 
i didn ’ t want to take anything else . 
but i will only bao nature and i have to go střídat . 
i go at center stage , likes to team i than i led it to someone else . 
some would have wanted to play , if i had to be as the nahrávač and to address this to the full . when something is forth , is a prd . 
indeed , you are the leader ? 
půlrok in příbrami when that this was not kustovi as kapitánovi , zranil , then were problems with money and he left . 
since then , we stoupali up and i still play . 
in brně , which i odchovanec , i střídal jedničku and dvojku . 
great year was in the city , i had long after it nabídek selected , and it is příbram . 
i wanted to odtamtud budějovice , i remained , but i sezonu , owing to the embolii he dropped out . 
now it is a new start . 
gold figure 22 . 
short polohovka remains phelpsovou province . 
" to be again stupních winners and heard hymnu is fresh as always , " smál , phelps had once again , and the eyes of tears . 
his snoubenka even mother again jásaly in hledišti , the son of boomer this time , peaceful way spal sluchátky on uších . 
prožívám neskutečný week at the conclusion of career . 
this is crazy - 20 years ago , i started závodně plavat and within a few hours will , after all , he dojatě . 
in finále for phelpsem by nearly two sekundy zaostal stříbrný japanese kosuke hagino , which won a long polohovku . 
bronz gained chinese wang šun , bronzový medailista discipline in the last of the world . 
after alu oerterovi ( disk ) and carlu lewisovi ( dálka ) is the third michael phelps sportovcem that the same ovládl discipline on four games behind . 
for most of the závodu with phelpsem held by other american ryan lochte and domestic thiago perreira . 
while of gold in the final kraulařské padesátce used to drtivému finiši , they are propadli outside medailové positions . 
the us will have superhrdina in rio even minimally a chance to expand its unique medailové sbírky . 
soon after the announcement of slavnostním polohovky postoupil into finále závodu per 100 meter motýlek . 
legendu could not upstage even krajan murphy ryan , who had znakařský double - after stovce won in rio and dvojnásobnou trať . 
in finále behind alone the 37 basis points australian plavce mitchella larkina , a third ended in russian jevgenij rylov . 
while the last of the world cup has murphy only fifth instead of dvoustovky in rio became znakařským king . 
from pomyslného heir apparent sesadil larkina , by the same double podařil is at last year ’ s world šampionátu . 
but the olympiádě gained medaili only now . 
the kraulařské stovce by the gold podělily kanaďanka penny oleksiaková and američanka simone manuelová . 
for šestnáctiletou oleksiakovou , it was the fourth medaile on these games , for the second manuelovou after stříbru from štafety . 
plavecké gold oh , at the first afroameričanka in history . 
i believe that i can be the model for other . 
this is medaile for all , who will after me , sport , for them and come to become láskou , where i , she dojatá manuelová . 
the third was švédka sarah sjöströmová , which in rio in the world record won závod per 100 meter motýlek , and there is a silver from kraulařské dvoustovky . 
all over the world šestá rekordmanka australanka cate campbellová . 
prsařskou dvoustovku won japonka rie kanetová , for which is not be paralyzed by 27 years in the first olympijská medaile . 
it makes no valuable metal and from the world cup , its peak to be the fourth , rather than in the discipline in 2013 . 
the second is in rio , russia ’ s julija jefimovová that , because of the games for start in the past , despite the drug faces nevraživostí viewers and soupeřek . 
once , i made a mistake . 
but i won in court and i don ’ t know why i was there to these questions asked . 
i tired of , say , much of russia ’ s plavkyně . 
the right for start in rio , vymohla to the special panel sports to arbitrage cas just before the start of the games . 
my odvoláním zabývali , and i won . 
this view someone , whether or not , or whether a different view , however , will be the arbitrážní court , china . 
hermannová : the disappointment , we could win . 
and the start of půlnoci ? 
this nepamatuju . 
češky experienced a day . 
it is less than an hour before the match the dozvěděly against whom takes . 
to manage the bleskově taktickou preparation . 
and then , in netradičním time to struggle to a small number kurtu 1 . 
the first hundred nezačaly well , then dotáhly margin soupeřek , but at the state of the 19 : 19 nezvládly koncovku . 
in the second was clearly better and srovnaly , but a decisive tie-break nevyšel them . 
above all , many pokažených servisů marked the failure of 10 : 15 and loučení with olympijským turnajem . 
" we could russian defeat , " litovala hermannová . 
how you zhodnotily struggle ? 
hermannová : after nešťastném for start than i ’ s front page rozehrála , so we got into the game . 
in koncovce me in the last balonu uletěl income , of which i am before zvykla . 
we have lost the hundred , which was critical . 
in other setu we on them in the field přehledem nastoupily with a defense and zatlačily we on servisu . 
in tie-breaku was much zkažených file , where we ubraly after téhle stránce . 
this was a disappointment , because we could russian defeat . 
sluková : pity the beginning of the first setu , where we this uteklo . 
can we do , but the us to withdraw bodíky chyběly . 
the second hundred was super and in the third by service . 
do we power mistakes . 
we darovaly them five points , and of the five , it was , there are a lot zaváhaly . 
it is a terrible , because russian were hratelné . 
how you a on a small number of 1 dvorci ? 
sluková , such as china 's byproduct dvorcích . 
climate , environment , and others . 
one was hodina at night , complete ticho , music , nothing nehrála nowhere . 
this was the relative to the center . 
such conditions , we nevybraly , but we cannot selecting . 
what was essential aims to struggle , when you found an hour soupeřek before the match ? 
hermannová : it was special . 
we rozcvičovat began to match without we knew protihráčky , so that we do not taktickou preparation as in other teams . 
but simon ( kouč nausch ) , přichystal tactics to almost all the possibility that there were . 
was prepared a lot of market with a tactic , so after téhle stránce we were well ready . 
pamatujete that you sometimes started with about the půlnoci ? 
hermannová : probably not . 
we are in play a 9 / , but not in the 12 . 
the bloc in the russian birlovové předkole play-off on oh in rio . 
plážové volejbalistky markéta sluková and barbora hermannová in embrace in předkole play-off on oh in rio . 
this was troubling ? 
sluková : the more that we are already in the last two struggles group from the decade , so we should regime posunutý sebelumnya . 
this was even more about two hours . 
this is odd nedovedu imagine that other sport has athletes who must podávat its best output in the 12 hours . 
but i think that we have set best , as we could . 
we knew that this will , but this is not a typical and about this is not the time to play a favorite image . 
as hodnotíte olympijskou experience ? 
hermannová : because he was a group of our goal , so it is on the one hand , in good order . 
we zvládly what we řekly . 
but now , after the battle , i smutná . 
sluková : i of this vyspím and from the olympic turnaj tomorrow be remembered only positively . 
is big brother , it is the first šmírovací sim . 
neuniknete it . 
the new rules are apply to all people without thai pasu that in the term in thailand will pořídit sim some of the local operátorů . 
so , not only to tourists , but also to people with the long-term vízy , which in thailand , for example , are or where forged marriage . 
the secretary-general ’ s national broadcasters , and the telecommunications commission takorn tantasith the congress that there are no exception . 
the plan sales sim that only foreigners a national telecommunications regulator to august . 
the new measures that allow their attitude surveillance , they authorities establish in six months . 
according to the tantasitha is a means to the national security , which to address trestnou activity is páchanou foreigners . 
moreover , the so-called turistické sim have assistance to people and that cross povolenou working term . 
for retailers would be to half a year should alongside sim určeným exclusively thajcům apparent and special sim to foreigners . 
barriers will be just as surveillance , which will be on cards diversion osobám without thai pasu permanentně zapnutá . 
is it possible to turn it off . 
this " as a sim for thajce is not because they can always easy to watch " doplnil tantasith . 
must be giving that in thailand , are not předplacenky anonymous as in the czech republic . 
prodejce requires doklad identity . 
on the other hand , a few years , one of the operátorů rozdával for free startovací sim turistům on letištích . 
so they were fully anonymous . 
the introduction of the same measure as thailand is contemplating ten telecommunications , regulators zahrnujících of other asian countries such as singapore and malaysia . 
even in them currently holds the compulsory or sim , but the use of sledovacího legal system is not possible . 
chystané measures , however , does not mean for any outsider to afford to entry into the country sim local operátora . 
of course , can use roamingové services with their own domovskou sim , in that case , the authorities will thai short on them . 
operátoři , after a country exceeding the following přihlášení sim to their network , known only síťové relevant information . 
they know that telephone figure , but not information about vlastníkovi . 
nevertheless , the roamingových prices vis-à-vis rates local operátorů is so that there is a majority of tourists , and in the course of his stay in thailand will look for local sim . 
the authorities have oversight of the momentum of organizations foreigners , by foreigners living in thailand legally has an immediate critics . 
tantasith situation comforting and in the context of protecting privacy chystaný system compares to be providing rezidenční adresy in immigration documents . 
the police will , in particular , the needs of the case , people need court order . 
for any of the system they will be closer neurčený punishment . 
if the provider of " services to watch polohu sim without the court order will be accused of felony conviction , " added tantasith . 
moreover , the system should also maximize the use of předplacených cards . 
while currently there would be a particular recycling figures to from 90denní that , for which the sim nepřihlásila to network , so the newly could , in the case of abandoning thailand ’ s happen to restore the numbers already days after the 15 . 
the apartment in novostavbě on vinohradech has bazén and vířivku on terase . 
why , you are an apartment in novostavbě ? 
we sought bezstarostný apartment , where most care about nemovitost obstará executive . 
condition was enough parkovacích jobs and výtah in the house , which essentially diskvalifikovalo older zástavbu . 
not to mention problematic akustice in the old houses , problems with houpáním podlahy , high energy intensity , and the like . 
condition were also the old zástavba terasy , which is not be able to offer . 
more interesting , you find in the modern apartment . 
the interiér to you proposed architektka lenka langerová its kolegyní kamilou polákovou from studies of artiga . 
this is why you oslovili ? 
would you doporučili cooperation with an expert anyone ? 
cooperation with architektem anyone , if we doporučili proposes apartment from the outset , it is a very complex technical process . 
the second rovina is the design interiéru : designéři have significantly better idea of a variety of nuclear materials and on the basis of thinking klienta are able to reconcile interiér properly . 
with architektkou lenkou langerovou we have worked to our horském apartmánu , then a personal recommendations on the basis of another klienta , and , given that all well fungovalo , it was clear choice for the us , even in the reconstruction of our new ’ s apartment in vinohradech . 
what was your practical and estetické demands ? 
we přáli velkorysý společensko-obytný room with sanitation properly for čtyřčlennou family pojatý as modern , but not chladný interiér . 
priority to achieve the ’ s apartment with terasami and implement intelligent management of households . 
and , of course , was to be uhlídat quality of style . 
you were all the odbornících , or you zasahovali themselves in the form of the final interiéru ? 
all proposals , including the technical and výkresů vzorků materials , but we endorsed proposal always resulted from architects . 
at the beginning of the we identify what we expect from designu , and have shown some elements of interiéru that we to integrate the country ’ s proposal to , for example , or koberce images . 
i believe that this is our sbírka largely českých authors involving the work of karl malicha , karl vysušila , václava špály or otto gutfreunda architektce helped move in our vkusu . 
the combination of a black , white , and ořechového wood was idea architektky as the pieces furniture , stěny , podlaha , lighting , koberce , textilie , art , etc . this , whether all combined ladí , we , together with ověřovali vizualizací . 
there are in implementing some of the challenges that you have to give up the original ideas , or on the contrary , it on a new ? 
perhaps only in the first phase of the project , when we came to a at a time when it possible for the first time in our podlaží výšky ascend , and found that výhledy that we plan , in fact , the stíní buildings . 
then we dispozice literally overnight fundamentally change . 
the kuchyňské line and obložení krbové stěny was used žula . 
in interiéru then dominate dřevěné povrchy complete kůží , for example , the čalounění jídelních and barových židlích norm from arperu . 
how you interiér charakterizovali ? 
chystáte a change , and there is something you are now přáli have different ? 
i suspect that a modern vzdušný interiér , which , achieve their ends . 
the change in the most nechystáme , after the nastěhování odehrála in rovině stínění and zabydlení teras . 
perhaps the only výtka is to [ the ] floor , when the us ořechové wood shows as too choulostivé to households dog . 
the word architektek , ing. arch. lenka langerová and mga. kamila hornychová , the authors implementation . 
apartment is in the last patře novostavby , it is possible , in the new construction to kompletně dispoziční solution and a few other adjustments . 
for interiér is an important element of putting světlovodů into ceiling chodby and the toalety . 
thus , we got into space tmavších light day ’ s apartment . 
the direct entry of the main koupelny on střešní terasu to bazénu from usspa is one of the construction adjustments , which was very beneficial for a the ’ s apartment . 
it is also part of bazén and vířivka . 
compared to the french are not negative , says muslimka living in prague . 
pocházíte of france . 
where everywhere you had before you have to přestěhovala thresholds ? 
my parents are původem of algeria . 
i was born in the south france , kousek from the spanish borders . 
quite enough , i stěhovala . 
i was in the toulouse lyonu , and marseille . 
in france , i vystudovala , thanks to investigate which i then came to work in one magazínu . 
why , then , you have decided to odstěhovat of the country ? 
i have a sense that started in france dusím . 
i already there simply nechtěla live . 
mainly because of the atmosphere between people . 
came to me that is any frenchman hrozně negative . 
people in france are negatively naladění in general , but lately , even this triple . 
it is interesting that zmiňujete had negativismus . 
some people takhle refer to the czech nature . 
trust me , compared to the french are not negative . 
some people it may come when come to france , because it as much as tourists marriage . 
but for me , it was too . 
the issue is to be money . 
people feel that they have little money , and the minimum wage in france is 15 hundred € , which is enough to me . 
moreover , there is now a problem with the behavior of people against muslims . 
this is for me is incomprehensible . 
for example , in the street , in which i was on me , my nemuslimský neighbor began dívat through ’ s only because i muslimka . 
as if i was a powerful . 
that is why i have in france necítila well . 
my family , but there remain . 
so , you have to go to other countries . 
why , you had a czech republic ? 
i look for work essentially elsewhere , and i narazila on free society instead on air france here in prague . 
přiznám that i from the start of the threshold neznala at all . 
the czech republic , i something věděla tatínek me even vyprávěl about what happened in czechoslovakia at all , but i nevěděla what from thresholds expected . 
now i ’ s three years and nedovedu imagine that i nebydlela here . 
this was a big difference , when you are přestěhovala from france to thresholds ? 
mainly owing to the very different the atmosphere . 
perhaps it is by nemluvím česky , so nedokážu capture a negative response or nadávky , but i feel that they are here people svobodnější . 
that i can do anything are forced to me , however , and no one will judge . 
in france , you still anyone uncomfortably dívá , such as when you have special clothes , and the like . 
in prague , i started to really free . 
pražané for such things to me nestarají . 
where working now ? 
after the jobs in the air france , i now worked for a road site . 
then we even with one kamarádem established the web site , in which people are shared offer and housing . 
so far , působíme only in prague , but we wanted to extend it to the central europe . 
you are in prague a czech friends ? 
here , i have two very close to the kamarády , who are czechs , and even half of the two kamarádky češky . 
i have to say that more specifikum czechs is that , the first holds more bay . 
nepustí , just as someone to tělu . 
this is quite , compared to místu , where i vyrůstala . 
in the south all objímají and líbají to face . 
here is another , but i understand that it is a matter of cultural , so snažím adapt . 
it referred you that nemluvíte česky . 
it is to you jazyková a barrier problem ? 
on the contrary , that i in prague quite simple , perhaps because every here are talking english . 
even in the večerkách or in food . 
i wanted to learn česky , but i do so much time . 
and , by any dovede at least bit communicate in english , i have a need for the language to learn quickly . 
and , each time when i have a problem , so i find someone who will help . 
setkala you also with nějakými negative reactions ? 
to be because you muslimka ? 
in essence , not . 
perhaps it is also by pracuji in the environment that is more tolerant . 
i can think of one experience me . 
my leadership , češka me , one of the french vyprávěla soccer team and pronesla something in the sense : after all , it is not the french , but the africans . 
this is quite dotklo me . 
but that should anyone with the problem that i muslimka , i still not . 
and yet , one that me colleague upozorňoval on a protimuslimské demonstrations . 
he , whether nechodím to the center of me that there will be nadávat . 
protimuslimské demonstrations partly to do with the terrorist attacks . 
how you to the current situation is ? 
bojíte has to be that something like a nice in paris , or brussels may become even in prague ? 
in prague , připadám safely . 
but the problem is that in today ’ s time may be anything everywhere . 
more recently , i was unable to imagine would be something that happened in france . 
and it is not just muslims . 
moreover , the violence islam neuznává at all . 
for me , people who are not , killing muslims . 
the koran says that one has the right to kill , because there is no god . 
as vnímáte , when the terrorists zaštiťují your faith ? 
this is a difficult . 
cítím stud and blame , even when i feel so not at all . 
snažím , the report violence nesledovat power , but each time when something přečtu , so i need is omlouvat for something that it is my blame . 
i very different one , so why should i be omlouvat for terrorists ? 
we have met to square jiřího of poděbrad . 
at the center of the čeští muslims and christians demonstrate against the violence . 
zaregistrovala you this ? 
i about nevěděla . 
but chápu so that they need dokazovat people feel that they disagree with the violence . 
i do think so that something that would have to be done . 
why should be to blame for something nezpůsobili ? 
setkáváte in prague , and with other muslims ? 
my officials are , for example , from egypt and other muslim countries . 
some are more religious than the i , so that we have sometimes quite wild discussion of islam , because it every bit vnímáme otherwise .

so when i am in the koran přečetla clause , which is that he prorokovi god to schoval its women from the rest of , say , i : i am not prorokova a woman , so why should i be schovávat ?

the big companies for of delivery into two hours zaplatíte several thousand . 
here zaplatíte to be stovku even less , because it is the way that someone has been taking . 
they should be traditional carriers to worry about a possible future of consumers ? 
we hope that it will be . 
the market is great potential , feeding them to the here obrovští multinational carriers , as well as trade chains , where all began to buy and gradually found that the neodpovídá , for what is true .

it is a local shippansee for a revised version of the czech market . 
and the application mesíkem mesíkem profi tersebut from this january and zpřístupnili users in the late july 2016 . 
since the beginning of the intention was done all of these applications that one day will join together to one . 
in the czech republic to application doladit and then , in cooperation with investor more focus on the global market . 
shared economy is in the last time issue , and this is the kind of service airbnb or uberu . 
nemáte fears of record in terms of power , which has no one can say is where the sharing and where the informal economy ? 
this is the same , akorát other product . 
if the us is clear that this will have the success and půjdeme with the up , we will another trnem in oku šedou through the economy . 
but , while some and save one pays , it is not intended circumvent financial authorities and tax control . 
every user , whether one or on the other hand , will be vybízen to danil their incomes , if the incomes of what to do . 
from what soudíte that service is so great potential ? 
odesílatel and save převozce actually pays , will reduce the cost of the way .

can emerge nice stories , people are happy of someone help , and they will about vyprávět . 
you must be some diantaranya berasal dari impor zapomenuté brýle lines , or pills . 
people , i have a longer period of time personal lack access to téhle application we say that it is a service people people . 
so how zaručujete that kurýr with package neprchne ? 
every user applications , along with it would scan registrací civil průkaz and banking , including the or credit card payments . 
these are the channels that are serving as a credibility . 
kurýři also pick hvězdičky on the basis of the odesílatelů . 
nabídneme and insurance , meskipun even ladíme . 
for nepojištěnou zásilku in the case of the losses or damage to guarantee kurýr nepřejímá , but , according to the criminal law responsibility for content , if it is something protizákonného within and knows about . 
if it to stop the police and find in closed package in his kufru samopal or ten kilo hašiše , přepadá criminal liability on odesilatele . 
don 't threaten the abuse of sensitive data from the data ? 
zaregistrovaní are in the case of the needs of dohledatelní company boards body that as one will be able to offer a glimpse of it , and we do we fail to is to see the data are against the abuse of protected . 
how much money receive the medical úspěšném add to hand kurýr ? 
kurýr determines the price and receive the full amount of that they say . 
moreover , the odesilateli naúčtuje several percent in mediating a contact . 
the money is our profit , but it is only a couple of percent , because we want to the press . 
no one can win kurýra obvinit that zásilku nedodal when it actually delivered takeover , and with the help of delivery ověřuje qr codes . 
some are constraints ? 
whatever the relative to the size of the or content package ? 
can anything převézt . 
there are three small size , as kostku másla , as central plato eggs , and the like basu piv . 
then there is no longer and further constraining if someone place in autě převeze , to be lednici . 
plus has odesílatel in the application of the package vyfotit , so kurýr see what , for it wants . 
it even nemusíte balit if vyloženě nechcete disguised content . 
zapomenutou mikinu strčíte kurýrovi in hand , and it is . 
who came up with the idea and how long it took a service ? 
he was kamarád idea has more than two years ago , at the time , i nevěnoval power attention . 
then i showed demo applications with transnational dosahem that address mainly on cestující plane . 
in the wait a minute i said that he nebudu for investors , but he would have wanted to the state , and to the savings . 
another year has lasted the development of more than we kredibilitě the product established in london firm shippansee ltd . 
but this is not a story , to which they are now , soustředíte . 
no , marketing , we have the czech republic , where we seek application dovychytat , because it should porodní the pain and what it is to address and improve . 
snažíme to respond to link a feedback from foreign customers and market is now so neřešíme . 
we know that this is of course a long trať nechvátáme , but we want to do good product for people . 
shippansee ltd was the basic nejdražší applications , and the other two were upgrade their way . 
převezu have been formed , when we say that the internal segment may be far more interesting , and that this is in the czech republic at least naučíme . 
the third applications mesíkem local , for the city . 
but can send a package of their precise street , even at the end of the world . 
works for odesílatele as převezu difference , but it is that , in it as kurýr see the medical in the form of points to the map that you are nejblíž , thanks to the geolokátoru in mobilu . 
applications for kurýry who want to feed the , we nazvali mesíkem profi . 
so anyone can vyloženě přivydělat by will be for the city packages vyzvedávat ? 
just last , applying to withdraw in prague , to be taxikář student , the mother of family vacations , someone who wants to gain the way to work . 
as now all blbnou with those pokémony , so that they can collected just . 
one sees , where the city are zakázky , přijede available klikne and see when it must be doručeno and zásilku převeze . 
this is significantly less than a competing service . 
at this point , we do even interface web sites , which will be essential for businesses to making zásilek on the web of them , the presidency data , or a points to the map . 
we are then use them to be capable of service every month vyfakturovat . 
project now věnujete on full-time ? 
vytěžuje us that we have , but it would at jobs to project can sustain and develop . 
the neskrývá over a transnational investor , we are two kluci , one of which should brilliant and to the idea of přiskočil with other incentives and ideas . 
now , when we seek investors strong enough to manage with us ukočírovat not czech market , but that should be prominutím koule with us to global gdp and become another huge player on the market as airbnb and uber .

after the conversion on the state of the 29 : 0 followed přestávka . 
it was , as if the fidži for ragby 7s narodilo , while the british are still to předávání . 
this is exactly takhle somehow . 
after the british poločase made mass change and the brunt fidžanů zastavili .... on the long four minutes , which in comparison with the first poločasem was good , as long as the brilantní mezihře fidži josua tuisova nepronikl further . 
dan norton tried to get the opportunity for the british hodil touchdown levého into a corner for increased ahn 36 : 7 . but struggle for long vyhráli people tichomořských islands and its fans on ochozech sang would smile flags and tancovali .

helen gloverovou and heather stanningovou to victory in veslařském závodě inspired by the trenéra with cancer 
in these games nenajdete emotivnější gold , and this is to say . 
since the scope of in the past , during the 220 trestajících výdechů in history , helen gloverová and heather stanningová another important in their point in the golden estacio de lagoa . 
even if the two were vesel seděly ship voices in three . when ship svištěla after the level of the olympijskému zlatu behind in závodě women dvojic with them in ship , was even voice still přítomného trenéra robina williamse . are the first women in the history of sport , such an outcome that outcome . 
the prevalence of their absolute was , overall , it was their 39 th závod , in which remain nepřekonány . 
what we see - two excellent atletky , as the level of water letí with elegancí swan - fails to reflect very nature victory . 
for every golden medailí of veslování is batalion pomocných hands , which kousek after kousku mean difference . and no hands nápomocny were more than hands trenéra that a nevěděl 30 months ago , whether to this day dožije , when he was zjištěna cancer . 
according to his words it was uncertain . 
i trpěl cancer močového měchýře that can operate more freely , and the operation i podstoupil . 
without operations could become them . 
it would be a very bad situation . 
this somewhat change your view of the cause . 
cancer was williamsovi zjištěna in december 2013 . 
happiness for the entire trio was that could nastoupit treatment in early 2014 , including sezónu , and so zkrátit disruption to a minimum - if it so can we in such circumstances , called . 
i giving needed money , so i had to make quickly together . 
this was an inducement . 
i was in the hospital , and i chodil room for - 20 stop , 30 stop , 50 stop at a time when said that the only a few steps . 
takhle this began . 
veslování itself is the way , but this was a bit more challenging . 
immediately after the victory of ideas were their first williamse , who was very nervous , i was less than the usual how to manage their own unrest . 
stanningová , kapitánka pluku royal dělostřelectva , which has behind mission in aghánistánu , she said : “ that a week , i was with emotions at the bottom , perhaps it is a bit extreme , but so does this power . ” 
this time , as the power to me , this is how we power and cooperate with helen robin as well . 
until now , it was three years , with fantastické helen and robinem . 
without robina we were not by none , like so is a huge dík , it is the best coach of the world . 
i could not have přát for a better training , even better kouče . 
helen gloverová and heather stanningová neprohrály only závod for five years . 
dvojice nasadila stunning structure , which their rivalky could not cope . 
even in the closing 500 metrech when began to accelerate crews of new zealand , and denmark , should stanningová with gloverovou very big rezervu . 
as we have in such a moment . 
helen křičela : “ nepřestávej , nepřestávej . ” 
is it really important nenechat , emotion push it . 
we had a good start , and at the same time , we can achieve something netoužily famózního . 
we netěšily in today ’ s ohňostroj , only we want them to be well zaveslovat , to go out and win závod , which we have succeeded . 
dvojice to take a year to rozmyšlenou than they decide what will happen next . 
gloverová next week vdává , it is the impending television dobrodruh steva backshall . 
now it is to the moment vychutnat . 
nechtěla i say that it will be my recent závod . 
this would mean little pressure . 
in london , it took about six months than they found that i olympijskou šampionkou . 
all of this was so new , i was so much in stress . 
here , it took about four minutes . 
i have a much better in this sense , ” she said .

oslavte with us ’ narozeniny central library in la . what 's new book next ? 
prison ? 
rather , whether vozí people for free is lovec taximafie rubeš to přelomové indictment . 
six taxikářů and former official magistrátu in prague are , to put it , čt obžalovaní . 
you natočil reportáží , many of which are found in fraudulent practices and those who have been in the group , which will be in a court of law . 
faced you , owing to a few nepříjemným potyčkám with odhalenými actors . 
as is power is to you report obžalování members of the organized group of a breakthrough ? 
i waited that to some court about it will happen . 
i zvědavý mainly on his conviction . 
think so , but that should be in prison . 
this is useless . 
in the should back all nakradené money . 
and they should is to return , so that everyone will vozit nothing . 
this is somewhat svérázné solution . 
this means that so declared punishment nevnímáte as a powerful enough ? 
for me is sufficient that some of them have such a fear that they have no longer work there . 
for example , one does pingla , another rozváží pizzu and one of this very vykašlal . 
in theory , two obžalovaní can be up to eight years in prison . 
it is to you adequate rate ? 
i have a problem with odnětím freedom . 
považuji a bad punishment . 
to someone to prison , especially in that case , it is nonsense . 
some people should be returned societies , what it take . 
a quarter of a century , páchali that our country ničili name and sprostě okrádali people . 
so now be doing good vizitku and rozvážejí people free . 
neumím , a otherwise . 
fungovalo as it would help to work . 
as someone go to collect odpadky , they would have cars , and nothing would vozili people in prague . 
no , they think , they are a condition , and they will be this one . 
they will find a way to somewhere cheat . 
the film sarjana academy miroslava ondříčka in the sand , at the university tomáše bati in zlíně . 
belongs to the people who in the czech republic , long last with virálními videi and videi directly to a . 
as for the internet works redaktor television stream.cz , which contributes to a pořadů , now is preparing a show prague guide , which is especially foreign určen divákům . 
those rubeš form of krátkých reportáží advised that services in prague , and to avoid what it recommends without fears use . 
before natáčel words with a series of how , a city fraud , ? life in luxusu , and enough ! and prague vs. prachy . 
in the indictment of them are talking about the as organized group . 
the police it a few months . 
can be a net sham taxikářů described as mafiánskou ? 
are they not roztomilí mafiáni , such as we know from kmotra . 
rather , it a mafiány - juniory , but are organized certainly . 
for only about that , each other hlídají štafly ( taxikářská box ) . 
prague is a rozparcelovaná . 
i vysledoval , for example , that the station , has rádo with the paris , paris , zas has to do with the taxi drivers who are waiting for karlových lázní ( disco club ) 
every , simply hlídá that their místečko , and every this group is somehow organizovaná . 
it is probably a spletitou network . 
but it is only dock together seven people , six taxikářů and a former official magistrátu warned that driver of the audits . 
as he říkáte , undesirable phenomenon of the streets nezmizeli . 
what about the percentage of between pražskými podvodníky in the taxi service , according to an estimate , it is your ? 
it is very small percentage . 
there are those of the worst on the street . 
for example , a mluvím alešovi ryjáčkovi . 
this is one that is actually dangerous - in his autě vozí teleskopický obušek , and every pátek and sobotu stand at the karlova mostu and vozí people . 
when i with him , most recently jel wanted to me seven hundreds of the three kilometry . 
his police for some reason nezadržela . 
an only a few people from all the major groups . 
the situation is the same , however , and other lokacích thresholds . 
indictment seven people so hard to vymýtí that the pražský nešvar , which is probably far greater scope . 
of course , it is not entirely useless . 
this will help , but all the nevymýtí evil , it is true . 
taxi drivers campaign , who okrádají foreign tourists , still in the same places that you showed in reportážích , so the karlova mostu or in paris street ? 
yes , exactly . 
in these lokacích is every day , and every day honored vyhlášky . 
it ignores the police , such as the urban pražský magistrát . 
this is not even kocourkov , but the indifference . 
business pražských taxikářů in than 
yet some of them , though it is only a part of the group , come to trial . 
this is already a breakthrough . 
that is why i have to ask : cítíte zadostiučinění ? 
if i took this as zadostiučinění , so it would be wrong , because my aim was , is , and will always to the center thresholds improving . 
and though i have a sense that it needs to have a little better , it will continue to continue . 
it is the need to press for the door on the other side . 
even if there will remain the zloděj , they should we do something for this to him odstranili . 
with this cannot be spokojit . 
but that this is not , of course , there are more . 
snažíš is still confront directly in taxících ? 
sometimes it ’ s testovací jízdy and i have to say that it is still wrong . 
just last week , i chytl taxikáře mimochodem , one of the same group , and was a překvapený that , in turn , i see . 
the naúčtoval 560 korun for three kilometry , although then argued that it was an amount 56 korun ( used the trick with desetinnou čárkou ) . 
should remember this stvrzenku , and that the police přijeli taxikář was so roztomile drzý that even chodil for those policemen and asked them , when he has finally be some of those 56 korun . 
a similar case . 
taxikář on taxametru přelepil desetinnou čárku and okradl tourists about 357 korun . 
is it to say that drzost sham taxikářů neustoupila and then what you in their záběrech showed masks of those who účtovali meaningless sums for a short jízdu ? 
their drzost is still incredible . 
as with the taxikářem domáhajícím , 56 korun fell ? 
the police to send down with by with him to a place to discuss cannot , because vystavil účtenku . 
and it will be , i think , even for the problem , the court ( the six taxikářů and one exúředníka ) . 
on the one hand , there will be a taxikář with its účtenkami , on the other hand , the police . 
but , according to the supreme court decision správního must magistrát use of the secret nahrávky vehicles taxi services such as proof in court . 
when i natáčel parts of their fraud , so i get taxi drivers of pointed out to me that precedent . 
but i images always wanted to use only in stories . 
you have concern that it is the fact that could to protect and on trial ? 
i hope that each judge understand that no taxikář would could not ignore the six or ten korun on kilometr , because this would neuživil . 
you spoke of taking away with desetinnou čárkou , especially in the foreign that their clients podvodní taxi drivers posouvají . 
it is still alive , or have concern that fígl after the your reportáží continue to use ? 
i believe that we that , on the contrary , the trick odvysíláním zpopularizovali . 
i recently jel with one taxikářem chvástal , with their mnou that he is it an honest taxikář . 
then , but i všiml that of alongside taxametru přilepenou cardboard underground . 
when i ask what it that there is , he told me : " you , you know what it . " 
when the taxikáře-podvodníky too nefungovaly fines , can on them been warning zapůsobit court with their colleagues ? 
it is anything , from fraud is what can be deterred ? 
you spoke about that , according to you will find a way to cheat , always . 
i believe that cannot be is nothing . 
but some of those jobs can drive . 
and this is féroví taxi drivers who should say more for that is odtamtud have gone seriously . 
from his experience , i have to say that those féroví taxi drivers in prague , prevail . 
but they desire to go against those who kazí reputation their services ? 
the appetite have , but they lack the um . 
can the power of the drag and can be said exactly what would want . 
when they organized the demonstration ( because of the proposal for celoplošné restrictions stemming from office primátorky adriany krnáčové ) , nevyznívalo power clear what it really want . 
once said that neprotestují against uberu that only want to have the same conditions , as it is the service , then zas claimed that want to more than uber . 
this fell , so that only block the threshold , and of this may be the only the best advertisement for uber . 
as the overall hodnotíte approach pražského magistrátu in the problem with předražováním fare was relevant ? 
it is to see that had to enter into this to the criminal police to something vyřešilo . 
magistrát was a short on it . 
there should krtka that vynášel information , this means that the taxi vykonávalo several years their work entirely unnecessarily . 
i hope that this úředníkovi naúčtují in the last control thwarted all control realized , what to do . 
i on how the will of the worst . 
i am with it even was one of the ride , which i found to turn from their rozpisu . 
from the recent publishing dílů seriálů homes to have one has a few months . 
what is odezva ? 
i mainly on foreign viewers , in than is , indeed , a series of the most focused . 
when i have always there kamarády from abroad , so that they videos pouštím . 
and , when , after jdeme staroměstském square , there are surprises that those samí people , what are seen on záběrech , is seriously . 
neslavně famous pražské celebrities . 
but seriously . 
he would plůtek around them to focus on them people koukali . 
muzeum communism directly on the street . 
my recent question is clear . 
jezdíte taxíkem when potřebujete ? 
clearly . 
jezdím services , in which i don ’ t have to pay hotově , but cards . 
využívám services like uber and liftago , where there is a fraud . 
but it is also dispečinků , many of which are fair . 
on the street , i took taxíka since then , only one . 
the driver me office , he said , " teda , but those máš courage . " 
bém in převlečení for italian turistu . 
a sham practices taxikářů , have been reported in 2005 . 
the former primátor paul bém in the same year vyrazil on the jízdu in převlečení for italian turistu , and now it driver ošidil attempt to the first two centuries . 
but worse was redaktor rubeš experience . 
he řidiči taxislužby naúčtovali for jízdu from staroměstského to square václavské 820 korun , which is about to 195 korun for kilometr how vypočítali policymakers reportáží . 
meanwhile , the maximum pražský magistrát set the price of 28 korun for kilometr . 
in natočené reportáží are also more surprising : dvoukilometrová sums , for example , a way out of the paris into the streets truhlářské cost turistu 400 korun . 
taxi drivers and expensive jízdy provide waiting for karlovo mostu . 
for jízdu on anděl , which has 2.5 kilometru , they must be charge and six hundred korun . 
the mramor myje largely clean water , what the most without chemistry , and the longer , the better . 
nečistoty of him go well , even when sometimes must be špína down skalpelem , it must be vydloubat from záhybů . 
this is not a simple , and it is not quickly , an earlier step toward their work restaurátorka vanesa trostová of oldřichova in hájích . 
klobouk down before it : náhrobek is obestavěný lešením , after which is to be bezpočtukrát vylézt and , in turn , slézt . 
" restaurátor should be careful , and trpělivý nenáročný working on the environment , " zkonstatovala . 
it is far from the first frýdlantsku on its restaurátorská work . 
because of it , for example , the recovery of dočkaly stone elements of fasády in the back left traktu frýdlantské radnice , restaurovala also marbles holy does magdaleny in zátiší , svatého jana nepomuckého in frýdlantě , pietu in frýdlantské okružní street , mariánský sloup in frýdlantu or atlanty in průčelí lázní in the new capital under smrkem . 
with the restoration of náhrobku melchiora kryštofa , and kateřiny of redernu in frýdlantu already began in 2011 . 
now the očišťuje emerging kamenných elements from nánosu nečistot and krust , the stone of the will to fall and shift ; either the will to kotvit stěny or to each other . 
it is also a nursing and konzervace surface . 
nápisy on hrobce again pozlatí . 
" then will zlacením nápisů on mramorových deskách ryzím plátkovým in gold , " initiated referentka state památkové care městského office in frýdlantu věra sobotová . 
in the past , are no records about that would náhrobek a nějakými opravami . 
on closer scrutiny , zaujmou otvory , vyvrtané in mramorových sloupech . 
are hundreds of years old , and it is the pozůstatky after výzdobě náhrobku . 
he was more than ozdoben , unfortunately , after nájezdu švédů třicetileté war has for all . 
literally náhrobek očesali , suggested sobotová . 
in a church svatého cross chapters are restaurátoři with only modest nadsázkou as at home . 
after povodni in 2010 , in order to be náhrobky , which were under water , restaurovala , křtitelnice , nástěnné malby in hrobce and now náhrobek . 
" in the future , we have dropped to vitráží , " prozradila sobotová . 
kostel is very different in good shape , each year to the maintenance and repairs vkládáme money . 
restaurátorské work to restore redernovského náhrobku will affect 128 on a thousand korun . 
will hrazeny of subsidies , the capital to that of the recovery will be no place our faith their money . 
a hundred thousand korun will be precisely from výhry krajském round of historical competition in 2015 , the city of 28 korun is then contribution to the culture , upřesnil mayor frýdlantu dan ramzer . 
by freeing výhry on restaurování náhrobku decided zastupitelstvo . 
the views of experts on the future evolution of selected to foreign markets sledovaný through indexů , compared with českým capital market ( px ) in run one month , and a half of the year . 
the prevailing in the market volatility and low growth . 
who would be even the beginning of the year said . 
the us index with the p500 , which , in february through 12 % of adjustment is now on a new historical maximum and since the beginning of the year , připsal already 7 % . 
again , so confirms iron rule that in the long run , they should never go against the interests of central banks , which ultimately has always been reached its . 
when they are in the american stock of historical maximum so again are vanishing volatility that is now the lowest since 2014 , when markets happy and without fear rose by quantitative easing america ’ s central bank , and when , as well as now index volatility ( vix ) held stabilně below 12 % . 
and to also not . 
although the fed markets increasingly preparing for a gradual increase interest rates , quantitative easing in europe and japan is in full flight , and in the last week přiložila hand to pull their weight , the bank of england , which in the coming six months nakoupí bonds of 70 mld. £ . 
a new wave of quantitative easing , thus pushing the already so low yield more and contributes to almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future . 
how long this state of lasts ? 
of course , this is the question for one million . 
in the us are no risk , the world economy has been a constant growth is almost without the large swings , the situation komoditním to stabilize the market , and china , and that brexit , in effect , the issue is not so that we should not be too well wonder if in the us , the regime ’ s klidném withstood stocks remain . 
damage that juncker nestuduje klause ! 
i very likes to that my friend michel barnier accept this important and hard work . 
i wanted to work for this obtížnou zkušeného policy , the head of the european commission juncker , when the french policy ( really zkušeného , as so many transnational protřelého various political offices that better example of the european elites we sought to broker ) has appointed the european commission , the uk from leaving the eu . 
junckerův sfoukl signs of hope that is in a serious concern for the eu with britain forms of future friendly coexistence . 
but most british media by the name barniera as junckerův act of war . 
barnier is skalní european federalista . 
the uk hate . 
as for the european union 's internal market ( 2009 - 2014 ) had a concerns the european banking reform rights . 
pojal it as it could pojmout only : he wrongheaded enemy anglosaského concept of the free market , and the model of capitalism . 
he multilateral regulations co-authored with the concept of a banking union and the záští of all of this , what comes from the city of london financial center , has pushed hard přemrštěně legislation and regulation , the financial services sector . 
so the michel barnier , an equal to london , paris in the conflict will be hard neoblomným , and perhaps even bezohledným broker . 
this is good news about . 
how can in this context nevzpomenout on klidné and distribution of friendly československé federation , which contributed to the rozvaha přehled empathy , and the prime minister václava klause . 
and , therefore , can now be czechs , slováky nejbližšími friends and allies . 
damage that juncker from václava klause - at least in this - nepoučil . 
this would be to buy all ! 
the around putin ? 
the kremlin ’ s rulers propustil its middle ivanova . 
russian president vladimir putin in pátek propustil sergeje ivanova from as a presidential administration . 
instead of his take over anton vajno . 
she informed about russia ’ s media odvoláním with the announcement was the press service , the kremlin . 
putin , meanwhile , has hinted that ivanova propouští on its own request . 
at the meeting that přenášela television stations rossija 24 , he said that it wishes to ivanova vyslovenému in in the post that he wants to be a leader of the presidential staff top four years . 
at the same time , announced that it will be ivanov his special representative to ecology and transport . 
the report of exchange at the forefront of the president ’ s administration , which now will lead the ivanovův representatives vajno is seen as a relatively a surprise . 
ivanov , which is 63 years , is the označován as one of the closest collaborators putin . 
the former kgb commander in the past , for example , took post of secretary of defense and místopředsedy governments . 
now leave the president and seat member of the security council . 
ivanov at the meeting with putin but said that it is by remaining in the head of state administration , indeed , rekordmanem . 
vydržel in it four years and eight months . 
in the associated with that in 25 years since the creation of its in that capacity is already vystřídalo 11 people . 
kvitová or deblistky strýcová , šafářovou , finále nezahrají . 
so far , neither of pátečních tenisových match has turned into finálovou participation . 
as the first its fight prohrála the great 's kvitová , which has succumbed to portorikánskému surprises monice puigové after setech 4 : 4 , 6 : 1 and 3 : 6 . 
kvitovou for a while , followed by the deblistky šafářivá strýcovou . 
while williamsových přemožitelky sisters in the first setu went all the way back to výhře promarnily , but the two setboly and russian eventually ukořistily hundred in struggling game . 
the second hundred then lose resulted 4 : 6 . 
under half that success in dopoledním program in rio zaznamenalo czech veslování : skifař ondřej synek with přehledem won his semifinále , when the second damira martina of chorvatska defeated despite zvolnění in the late by almost sekundu . 
today 's good , conditions were super , wind , zklidnil . 
i have tried to save as much , reported synek . 
his opponents , unlike he had to fight to do so . 
so they a power ubralo , it would be tomorrow could be simpler . 
but neříkám that it will be a simple , only to me , this is playing cards , declared veslař pražské dukly . 
but in mirka topinková-knapková snykových šlépějích nekráčela . 
pětatřicetiletá veslařka shoal in today ’ s semifinále ride in their position in the fourth and sobotu it to start in b finále and fight about 7 to 12 instead . 
so neobhájí gold in london . 
for the first time i on olympiádě nepostoupila into finále . 
but this mrzí trošku me , on the other hand , i jela high-quality závod and i turned into , everything it . 
soupeřky were just better , sklonila before them topinková knapková . 
bojovala until the end of the and believed that their čtvrtých games among the elite šestici will . 
the vzdala to just before the goal . 
i věděla that are holky balanced , that of this field can postoupit anyone . 
by číňanka me that had such finiš . 
and i have thought that more than rakušanku to tell finále postoupit . 
unfortunately , today 's jela living závod , she mistryně world of 2011 . 
beyond the finálovými barbarians at the rio remained in the young střelec filip nepejchal , which or again failed prodrat of skills , this time in malorážky leže . 
it has 33. nepejchal in place . 
the skills best published confidence . 
the first far down postoupil sergej kamenskij with 629 points out of the second kirill grigorjan ( 628,9 ) . 
nepejchalův nástřel should value 620,5 point . 
the program for the first time in rio promluvili also atleti , between them and the czech sedmibojařky kateřina cachová and eliška klučinová . 
cachové include after the second discipline olympic competition 9 / instead , czech rekordmanka eliška klučinová is dvaadvacátá . 
there is a britka katarina johnsonová-thompsonová that skočila into výšky 198-kilometer foot , with time , as well as the second belgičanka nafissatou thiamová . 
both the left by historically best výškařský performance in the sedmiboje . 
pokoušely even skočit 201 foot , but neuspěly . 
russian , german , who is worse ? 
aside from the absurdity such questions : the german society has created a deep sebereflexí , while russian not . 
in the two major eurasijských národech vyskytli dictators in the twentieth century , and got to power regimes that were inhumane , and the brutal strašné . 
russia ’ s bolševici since the 1917 in 1989 přispěli largely to 94 millions of victims of communism , argues that “ black book communism , whether this daily by individual repression , targeted famine , a case of incompetent leadership war or inhuman experiments . 
the nazis nelidským way wiped out of around 6 million of jews and the victims of world war ii , with the 60 million . 
the obsazovaných or opouštěných territories prováděli savagery germans and the soviet . 
in germany and the ussr was not only a few vinno individuals , but much of the nation , those crimes in whether it actively , or just passively zbabělostí or strkáním into the sand . 
this is not only specifika these nations , we czechs are similarly vinni . 
in germany , the immediate ending the war came denacifikace , norimberský tribunal . 
but the most important it came later . 
when children up , began to ask : tatínku dědečku , why ses účastnil such atrocities ? 
as for this could ! 
it has a reflection on recovery and society . 
germany ’ s elites have recently staraly mainly on the prosperity of the country , eliminating poverty , citizens ’ wellbeing . 
and now have different ( often naivně idealistické goals ) , but it is not to join them back alsasko-lotrinsko or someone - to revanš - militarily to attack , perhaps accepts every . 
after the cold war to prohrané in russia , there has been no major reflection on . 
the potential positive changes , finally , has closed at the turn of the millennium , when it came to power , the former kgb commander ( sic ! ) , vladimir putin . 
often zločinná background , it is now in russia oslavována . 
the policy of putinovskéhu russia is revanš , conquest of lost territory , the humiliation of the west . 
health , prosperity , and the future of their own people is not for věrchušku no value . 
bij their , and foreign will be few . 
still , i believe that it is only those decades despotic regime that russians are genetically or culturally méněcenní - destined to asian ( themselves ) tyranny . 
who benefit from growth tensions around crimea ? 
ukraine ’ s military . 
in recent days and hours came to the deterioration in ukrajinsko-ruské line in terms of crimea . 
growth is good for whom tensions ? 
for a long time , the relative calm occurred again to another better relations between ukraine and russia . 
the ukrainian party became the peninsula krym , who was připojen of more than two years to russia , and is part of its territory . 
the news from both sides protiřečí znepřátelených , of course , and it is difficult to independently ověřovat , and so we have the ability to the old known only to the question of who benefit from this ? 
according to the news from moscow came to the terrorist attacks on krym of ukraine ’ s party , which of course , refuses to ukraine , and blame the kremlin of provocations . 
the information about the arrest of ukraine ’ s special forces on the territory of russia ’ s came from the case pilotky savčenkové known , the answer is that were on the territory of russia ’ s uneseni . 
if we had accepted in ukraine 's version , in what russia would be the deterioration of crimea ? 
the answer is simple : in ničem . 
the escalation of tensions around crimea only russia can hurt , mainly by the west in the form of another přitvrzení sanctions and upgrading protiruské campaign . 
in the past year came to the immigration crisis in europe to retreat attention from the situation in ukraine . 
ukraine ’ s leadership has already lost before its obyvateli completely kredit , when the current support for president porošenka hovers around 15 % . 
ukraine 's economy would not have long zbankrotovala štědrých financial injections mainly from the eu and the imf . 
in this situation needs ukraine ’ s regime again decisively focus to his country , so that zdůvodnil their demands for more financial aid and he sought to improve the reputation of voters in his country . 
president porošenko and other members of the leadership silových establishment has once again to prove strong men who nebojí confront a large and russia . 
one hopes that to all those who tries to rozpoutat open conflict between ukraine and russia , ultimately realize its enormous responsibility for troops , but not only the lives of ordinary people znepřátelených on both sides , and its peak in time hostile action .

“ animé ” effect on the snapchatu is kritizován as a caricature of the asian 
according to the snapchatu is this filtr inspirován animé , but some observers say that is rasově necitlivý . 
applications snapchat every day for about 150 million users to change the reality of pohrávat with identity , and in ways that shares a border with the absurdity now . 
you can do themselves from ananas dog , or postavu , which would like to the country ’ s image of roye lichtensteina . 
filtry are simple instruments that deformují reality , and every day , generate more than 30 million vylepšených selfíček . 
any chybička immediately uveřejní . 
in the past , filtry snapchatu vysloužily criticism , with the charge that use of promoting higher-value blackfacing or that supports the white odstíny skin as the ideal of . 
so when that week users offered filtr , with which they slippery eyes distorted kicking and and bubbles faces , some critics portrayed it as a kind of “ rasistickou asiatů - yellowface . ” 
and ptali , whether these repeated tricky question nepoukazují on greater problem society - the problem with diverzitou . 
in the center of the verge and motherboard wrote and news and anger , rapidly increasing and snapchat just another day said that the job . 
the company to explanation : filtr was zamýšlen like a accounts postavám animé , not as a caricature asiatů . 
but observers , who have seen racism , filtr připoměl painful stereotypes in action . 
other without to compared to the animé rejected . 
grace sparapani student , america ’ s art of korea , whose tweet about fotografiích was widely sdílen in e-mailu put it , “ that filtr was at least harmful and seems . ” 
she added that “ it is difficult to argue against the očividné asian karikatuře and filtru effects . 
it turns out that filtr is not only a žlutém obličeji ( yellowface ) , but that is in the faces of the žlutý dotažen pohrdavého extreme . 
snapchat is not the only companies that these cultural překročila limits . 
it seems that american culture in itself , has endless struggle for diverzitu and inclusion , from zasedacích síní in corporations , it after holywood and equipment , which all nosíme in the hands of the . 
and the huge amounts of young people in the snapchatu - who are more rasově diverzifikovaní older than their partners , could mean that can be expected to an even greater sensitivity . 
“ if one filtr snapchatu a picture that is for some users offensive , ” she pětadvacetilá katie zhuová in čtvrtek in an interview , “ very difficult to don things now obejdou unnoticed , as it was before . ” 
katie zhuová , produktová manažerka and návrhářka that works for medium , in its čtvrtek decided to account for snapchatu smazat and called for others to make this the same . 
in an article for medium and put it in a after the telephone , that is convinced that rasově motivated problems reflect a lack of diverzity in náborech workers in snapchatu . 
katie zhuová criticized most white , entirely mužské leadership society and article zakončila hash tagem : it deletesnapchat . 
this is the “ either , so that they have no diverzitu between workers and color people at a time when the těchhle determines issues , ” she zhuová , which has čínsko-americký origin , or “ there barevní people work , but not to positions , to be felt safely or příjemně to promluvili . ” 
some observers share its view - stížnost snapchat , which has in large scale without answers . 
the company neuveřejňuje numbers about diverzity its employees with the , that is the status of private companies . 
in čtvrtek snapchat refused to talk about rasovém of its workers , but , according to a society ’ s press spokesman , recently náborového worker , which should be to focus on an zastoupenou population and an internal management inclusiveness . 
providing zhuová : “ i zvědavá , whether they really need more such users , who can say that this is in order , ” with by its bill will remain zrušený . 
military officers zkreslovali intelligence is a parliamentary commission says , 
the parliamentary commission ’ s report in čtvrtek reported that officers from central velitelství united states měnili report intelligence services to vykreslovaly more optimistický picture of the war against the islamic state in íráku and in syria , providing than the events of the country . 
according to the preliminary report working group sestavené republican president of the committee armed forces , committee intelligence services and podvýboru for defense , was “ zjištěna widespread discontent ” between the analysts central intelligence service , which , according to their nadřízení měnili their assessment of america ’ s effort to defeat the islamic state . 
the central velitelství , known as the centcom , is the central tampě armádním in florida , which are at the us military operations in the middle east and central asia . 
in tiskovém statements to report stresses : “ outcomes intelligence intelligence officers approved nadřízenými centcomu usually were offering a more positive image protiteroristických efforts , the us than what was potvrzeny skutečnostmi on the ground , and were konzistentně absorb the better than získávané analysis of other parts of the intelligence community . ” 
“ what happened in the centcomu is unacceptable , our fighters are poškozeni , when it is bad policy nadřízeným menerima analysis , ” said ken calvert , and a republican congressman from california . 
the failure of the leadership in centcomu extends to the top of the organization . 
in desetistránkové report details deficits are continued problems central staff to describe and analysis of america ’ s efforts in tréninku íráckých forces years in 2014 and 2015 . 
even if the offers no evidence that the obama administration ’ s chief leaders were ordered to report pozměňovány , the report stresses that analysts should the impression that they were from the party leaders centcomu under pressure to prezentovali more optimistic view of the dangers posed islamic state , or is . 
“ in the first half of the year 2015 was tiskových reports , many central staff , user reports of congress statements and substantially pozitivnějších than those events , in fact , ” in the report . 
for example , the official centcomu publicly argued that a military attack to takeover mosulu could start back in april and may in 2015 . 
mosul , the second largest city íráku , remains in control of the islamic state . 
this is the “ after months investigation entirely clear , ” said in statements representative mike pompeo , a representative of the republican party of kansasu . 
since 2014 half by the middle of the 2015 manipulovali top positions workers intelligence services central staff outcomes with the us intelligence services staff to downplay the danger is in íráku . 
the republicans sestavili working group after the threat of she analysts about the intelligence services information about the islamic state are manipulovány . 
the report uveřejněné in čtvrtek must after another investigation podrobnější to follow . 
in the intelligence services centcomu is yet another investigation , led by the general inspektorem department of defense . 
democratic members of the committee intelligence services uveřejnili čtvrtek in their own findings , some of which counterintuitive working group republicans . 
“ between years 2014 and 2015 centcom created a very narrow process for a assessment of information about is and íráckých security složkách , ” said in statements reprezentant . adam b schiff , the chairman of the committee and representatives of the democrats . 
according to the words adam schiffa this process of “ led to překrucování outputs intelligence services , ” and “ hurt morálku between the analysts ’ s zohledňoval nesouhlasné views . ” 
nevertheless , schiff and democrats argue that nenašli no evidence that the white house to press for analysts centcomu to upravili their conclusions , according to the “ předlohy or political situation . ” 
furthermore , the results of the parliamentary inquiry in úterý uveřejněny in daily beast . 
last august , the new york times informovaly probíhajícím investigations of the pentagon inspektora that well underway after stížnostech analysts centcomu . 
komandér-poručík patrick evans , the spokesperson of the pentagon in statements said that the department of defense parliamentary report will not be komentovat , because the investigation inspektora still continues . 
but , said that “ experts sometimes neshodují interpretation of the complex data , and that the intelligence community , and the department of defense welcome healthy dialogue about these crucial otázkek national security . ” 
has the effects of investigation beyond the question is whether the us-led bombing in íráku successful ( and syria 's , argues that now growing number of leaders defense ) . 
nevertheless , the last charges has otazníky about the extent to which the president obama can rely on that central staff serious about refer to military operations in íráku lybii , afghanistan , and other parts of the crisis . 
criticism news about the islamic state ’ s conflicts for more than a decade , when analytik intelligence services centcomu gregory hooker wrote research organization work , in which uvádělo that president george w. bush ’ s administration - despite námitkám many analysts - justify little unit in íráku and focused little time to think about what will follow invasion in 2003 . 
hooker also play a key role in services zpravodajským backlash against the islamic state . 
last year , the authorities announced that hookerův team concluded that , despite the public statements about opaku , pie in the us-led rafineriím strikes against the islamic state is significantly financial resources the terrorist groups neoslabily , because the established a temporary rafinerie oil and sold in an unofficial market . 
the september 11 times in congress about the findings but not předána outside of the staff . 
the commander centcomu , gen. lloyd j. austin iii , was then podroben criticism uplynulý year after many legislators shledalo accounts senate too positive with assessing the war . 
general austin in april act in and replace it centcomu gen. joseph l . votel . 
the us prevailed in pozemním hokeji in the fourth is in place , it now will play a decisive struggle in the united kingdom týmem 
katie bamová in the battle against japan , which ended 6 victory : 1 , vstřelila three branky and one day after for america ’ s ženský team pozemního hokeje vstřelila the first two branky struggle , in which čtvrtek in america , indeed , india 3 : 0 . 
five branek in two zápasech success is hodný zapamatování , but bamová ( 27 ) said that it is not clear whether it sometimes something of such managed . 
i have “ idea , ” she said . 
nepatřím between those who their branky zapisují . 
but this knows : američane at turnaji lead to struggles 4 : 0 and dělí a place in the first group , with the united kingdom , which remained čtvrtek after its defeat in japan ’ s 2 : 0 remained neporažená . 
the united kingdom and the united states in the former sobotu in the past is the first round . 
both teams , kvalifikovaly into čtvrtfinále and struggle will determine who from the six teams will come to an end to the first and who on the second . 
in the first place , a little longer vyhne strong dánům , who are at the forefront of the second group . 
whatever sobotní struggle to end , however , americans here its a surprise driving triggered by arguing , four years after the what skončili between 12 teams of the games in london . 
in the team was bamová . 
grew up in the blue bell in pennsylvania , and hokejku on hokej took on the ground for the first time in hand , when it was 3 years older ( her sisters in the twin played drexelu ) and the national team now , when it was 16 and become his nejmladší hráčkou at all . 
take in 2008 , because it escape the banks had not received in the final soupisku . 
then came the year 2012 , when the power of failed or it , or členkám its team . 
another year was appointed trenérem angličan craig parnham and things began to change . 
“ cultural change , mental change , physical change , ” she bamová . 
in london , we should not , such as the rate of labor , we have today . 
we are also full swing . 
in čtvrtek at night bamová began in the first half of the vstřelením branky bekendem of close . 
india to struggle nastoupila without victory in turnaji team , but has proved a surprisingly hard and keeping score 1 : 0 until the end of the third quarter , when bamová used the opportunity . 
to escape the left side of the hracího fields , then prokličkovala to the center and vstřelila míček into branky to američanky came into the leadership 2 : 0 . 
melissa gonzalezová joining the drive half in the fourth quarter . 
vyřazení brankářky američanek , jackie briggsovou that in any of the three victory has helped to one brance , was the first to turnaji . 
it is in the form of výborné . 
just as bamová . 
“ we are now on a good place , ” said parnham , but it is not as good , depending on the outcome of the sobotního struggle . 
in the midst of the olympic rage zen trampolíny 
it is irrelevant , where you , is one of what is hours - is take . 
the events in rio de janeiro is feel of nepopsatelné and zaujaté střídání competition and effort . 
this is how would itself olympijská pochodeň was žhavým štafetovým kolíkem , which is from lustřelce plavci , and gymnastce triatlonistovi . 
you zapnout tv read the newspaper or then listen your neighbor in front in when you heard , without a simone bilesové , katie ledecky or the hostility among michael phelpsem and chadem le closem . 
and it is even logan dooley . 
the upcoming dooley , a favorite of women with dolíčky in tvářích , is on the olympiádě for the first time , and could also be among those whose names times in households in the main vysílacím time between beyoncé and spoty donors , if it was plavcem gymnastou , or even šermířem . 
but dooley ( 28 ) of lake forest in gold in california for the olympic skocích on trampolíně . 
olympic fire nesvítí on all competition as well . 
away from the center , some in the shadow of are sporty , which are widely recognized : the shooting of vzduchových pistolí , lukostřelba , badminton , taekvondo . 
we will always be success in klasickém plaveckému style , and is likely to be a long rule . 
but if i on its extraordinary favorita , let me upozornit on nenápadné kouzlo trampolíny . 
even if they are to skoky trampolíně olympijským sport since 2000 , when they were first put on the games in sydney , remains after 16 years intervention the sport has unnoticed , many people , which i dotazoval , or nevědělo that this is the olympic sport . 
it can be a regional indifference . 
the us has never medaili in skocích on trampolíně nezískaly and until 2012 , none of atletů not even to finále . 
prices in mužské category is usually dělí between china and russia , and in women ’ s category between china and canada . 
this year , the golden medaile from london objahovat dong dong from china and rosie maclennanová of canada . 
skoky on trampolíně have yet another smůluo , partly because uchu nezasvěceného will be more seem that more suited to klaunskou university than the olympics . 
i have to admit that i am expert , but only nadšenec sledující from the country . 
this has komický potential - komiksové vibrace indefinite odrážení , but also ladnost gymnastiky and potápění , two sportů , which combines itself . 
the word “ trampolína ” is odvozené from the spanish “ el trampolín , ” which means “ skokanská deska . ” 
aspirující champions skáčí on the huge trampolíně , which is vystřelí into výšky to almost 10 meter and předvádějí sestavy with several elements of ( salta screws , and a combination of ) than finally again přistanou on nohách . 
according to official olympic program are hodnoceni according to enact obtížnosti “ , and , in the air . ” 
in rio will be to compete dvaatřicet atletů of 17 countries 16 16 men and women . 
the typical trajectory olympic by is forward . 
warriors of gold medaile must go further , faster , and even higher , sometimes until late , and sometimes to back up and down . 
trying to dohonit not only target pásku or startovní wall , but how television news reports , as well as other pomyslnou line : the world or olympic record . 
this is noblesní jednomyslné efforts , obdivuhodné , a bit fanatické - and sufficient to prevent the audience ’ s to slzám . 
but it is also a comprehensive according to me , when the olympics sledujete . 
in this respect trampolíně skoky to provide relief . 
by atleta on trampolíně is upward .

“ protestující generation ” in ethiopia , the us allies dlouholetém 
the violent protests in ethiopia 
after požadující political change in ethiopia encountered implementation violent resistance governments . 
survivors say that during the conflicts with the police was zastřeleno many protesters . 
there is in ethiopia war ? 
in the past decade , it was one of the nejstabilnějších nations in africa , a solid the western alliance with a rapidly growing economy . 
in recent months , but the country nation-wide anti-government unrest , which is spreading to still more areas . 
just as the last week vyrazily into the streets of thousands of people who are demanding a political change . 
according to the forces for human rights , was the reaction governments ruthless . 
svědkové argue that the police and the zastřelili zabili neozbrojených protesters . 
the kolujících videonahrávkách from the protests that is likely to come from the late last year , or the beginning of this year , are them engaged members of the security forces , as mlátí young people holemi after were donuceni state in the wall of rukách . 
the un high commissioner for human rights , now calls for a careful this . 
“ always be hard to maintain the country together and to step forward will be even harder , ” said rashid abdi , leading project horn of africa research organization group for international crisis group . 
ethiopia is after the second nigerii nejlidnatějším not in africa , and its stability is podporována with the west . 
the us military and intelligence services are working closely together with etiopany on eliminating the terrorist attack on , above all , somalia , and few of african countries , if at all , gaining any such help from the west . 
ethiopia ’ s economy is revealed through have established pace . 
its infrastructure is crucially improved - in the city addis ababa , even a new příměstský train . 
and the street cities are typical klidné , secure , and clean . 
but , ethiopia , can be ztěží call a model of democracy - organizations campaigning for human rights , without ustání talking about government represích - the opposition in the country has been contained , dissidents effectively silenced . 
many of them was vypovězeno , imprisoned , or usmrceno vyhnáno far in deserts . 
but this is can change . 
“ if the people dusíte , and they have no choice but to to protest , when the cutting , ” said seyoum teshome that přednáší at the university of central ethiopia . 
all protestuje youth . 
protestuje a whole generation . 
complaints made many and concern is the everything from disputes about the stage for the absolute control the power of the governing coalition . 
after last year ’ s elections , which were widely kritizovány , won the ruling party and its allies have a seat držené opposition , and now in control parliament 100 % . 
at the same time , pressure is building on the border with eritreou . conflict along this nepřesně vyznačené , disputed border in the june killed hundreds of lives . 
anylitici fear that separatist groups , which were during the past decade , as is more or less repressed oromská liberation front , or ogadenská national liberation front , can try to use the confused and again , vyzbrojit . 
there are several factors , which explain why , after years of now doutnání below the surface , these bitter feelings rozhořely again . 
the first of them is seemingly benign : smart phones . 
many etiopanů can communicate through social networks until the last several years , when became routinely available cheaper smart phones , and improving the provision of internet service . 
and , even if the government forbidding access to facebook and twitter , as it is normally , during the protests , many people can still communicate across the internet proxy that skryjí polohu these people . 
several youngsters etiopanů promluvilo about how shromažďovali to protest . 
then there is more solidarity among oromy and amhary , the two largest ethnic groups in ethiopia . 
oromové and amharové are natural allies . 
after a long věky amharové , mostly from the christian vrchů ethiopia , vynikali in politics and trade and used oromy , many of which are the muslims and live in nížinách . 
but this , too , is changing . 
“ we are on the road to sjednocenému leadership , ” said mulatu gemechu leader , oromů . 
to the protests have been in areas owner amhary and oromy . 
many amharů and oromů believes that ethiopia neprávem dominated by the etnika tigrajů , which form of around 6 % of the population , and controls , the military intelligence services , trade , and policy . 
the third reason unrest is deaths meles zenawiho . 
zenawi , the leader of the insurgency was etiopským the previous government 17 years , until his death in 2012 , when podlehl neuvedené disease . 
he was seen as tactical genius , a man who was seen as roh . 
analysts say that particularly mistrně to detect early signals of discontent and used to vyslanců opponents zpracovali and get on his party . 
“ the regime lack basic knowledge , ” said , abdi analytik conflict . 
the new prime minister hailemariam desalegn , ethiopia , was vytažen of neznámosti relative to replace the zenawiho . 
unlike zenawiho , which he came from the tigrajské of northern ethiopia , hailemariam comes from the south . 
analysts argue that have confidence in the security services state-controlled tigrejci . 
many worry that the result will be another prolévání blood . 
the ethiopia has had such riots in 2005 , when , after the thousands of people protestovaly against what analysts portrayed as elections , which the government zbabrala and then ukradla . 
this was followed by a action , which was in many of those protesting the verdicts were killed - even when less than in the past few months - and this period unrest přešlo relatively quickly . 
experts estimate to develop leaders in ethiopia vizionářské infrastructure planning , that is a new příměstský train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty . 
but it is clear that a gradual narůstání disputes within ethiopia ’ governments not stop . 
and there has been nebezpečnému etnickému shaping . 
last month , protestující in amharském city gondar napadli trade tigrejci owned businesses and resentment against tigrejcům on social sítích increasingly common . 
analysts say that the protests by the unpleasant situation , the us and other western allies . 
the us government uses ethiopia , as the basis for přelety drones over neighboring somálskem , even when recently said , was concluded that base . 
while the west wants clearly promoting democracy , and at the same time , does not want to its ally in the region and nestálé collapsed . 
this “ abdi , ” said , “ it is very hard sharp hrana . ” 
donald trump explains its ruling on obama and the funding is as “ sarkasmus ” 
donald trump j. in pátek to downplay the controversy that zaplavuje his campaign by that this seriously thought , when this week has lasted several times that preziden obama and hillary clinton were “ fathers ” terrorist groups of the islamic state . 
the explanation of creating a new questions about its ability to speak a republican candidate for president with the american public . 
opposed to the unpleasant also its advocates , who was a stormy time it in check , and must explain that his remarks may seriously thought . 
after this proposal to the assembly in the center of the night trump famously in čtvrtek confirmed and in the talks insisted that does not intends to say that the president and h . clinton is stvořili . 
but in příspěvku on twitter in pátek i trump has said that he was only sarkastický . 
the opposite of the contribution was the only one day , with trump in several talks said that their charge , think seriously . 
when conservative rozhlasový moderátor hugh hewitt , to help alleviate the trump year připomenutím that obama is sought to the destruction of the candidate for president , the republicans nereagoval . 
the latest storms comes at a time when trump to focus attention on his campaign on the economy , while his preferences in opinion polls falling . 
trump and clinton , this week in účastnili michiganu duelu to economic issues . 
in pátek trump to return to the theme again . 
on twitter again warned that clinton ’ s proposals are spojeny , raising taxes , and said that , according to the nějk was its ground nudná . 
trump , the defense sarkasmem already before . 
at the end of july , when sklidil wave of when goes with a proposal that russians should insights to e-mailům clinton , a year later explain words : “ i , of course , sarkastický . ” 
this approach allows trump pushing the political statements and , according to contain it needs . 
“ i think that it is to his way testing , the extent to which have some reports traction in his supporters , to see ways to respond to the response , and then one way or the other “ friendship explanation , ” said ruth sherman , specialist of the communication , which the language that both candidates used . 
also , but i think that is in their prohlášeních obratný and knows that are vague enough to be possible to explain approach in different ways . 
because the polls in his to continue to fall , he chose trump in recent days even more uštěpačný tone , instead , to cause for universal mírnil voters . 
a new survey nbc / wall street journal / marist , who was in uveřejněný pátek , showed that tump is with a great under clinton in north karolíně virginia , and koloradu and very close to it , florida . 
trump is really is to avoid omluvám for staged provocative statements , that is , but often its critics has accused of incorrect interpretací their words or misunderstanding its sense of humor . 
but , together with the trump , as in the closing months presidential campaign faces heightened attention , trump ’ s uvedly vtipy into the unpleasant oddané his followers , who for it must be publicly , whatever his remarks as staged provocative . 
w. rudolph giuliani , an earlier primátor of new york , which is one of the nejprominentnějších trump supporters , it had candidate in čtvrtek in a cnn obsáhle to defend . 
“ i believe that what he says , is rightly comment by the political , ” jelasnya giuliani , when he was asked on the credibility of trump ’ s claims about that obama and clinton founded by the islamic state . 
this is true in the sense that was before obama is almost unknown , small organizations that completely chybně nazýval nováčkem . and that happened because withdraw its troops from iraq . 
most ordinary republicans tries to argue that the obama administration , in which clinton looked like of foreign affairs , is allowed to bujelo and failed aggressively to handle the situation in the middle east . 
before the pátečními shromážděními in pennsylvánii trump continue to on twitter around themselves dštil fire at the media for every přemílají its word and are zaujatí to it . 
vysmál “ ubohým , patetickým ” television učencům , who understand , and it is said , “ it cannot ! ” 
several democrats , trump ’ s omluvě ušklíblo with by is this just another proof that , for the presidency is not způsobilý .

kavárna verb cafe ošuntělé rather than it was in the williamsburgu , where you could pay only hotově , without wi-fi , but where káva podávala already 15 years .

but if new york change , it is also znovuobjevování . 
vzkříšené verb cafe has opened the last november greenpointu , less than mile severně from his spot . 
the new verb has wifi and is its cards , but there are some of the original workers , and there is there a similar , skromná atmosphere . 
it is also káva still good . 
a new manažerem verbu is cisco rodriguez , long-time proponent of the original coffee shops that is also an owner and managing director of the new jobs . 
in the verb started in 2001 , and remained until the end . 
when he one of customers offered that pays the shift to a new instead , said that it does with the state . 
rodriguez ( 36 ) stranded a lot of things as they were . 
verb still have the same suppliers bread and koupil the same model of the espresso .

“ i realized that i have to do what is káva and culture in verbu , ” she said . 
now , once again , pije kávu , but in the day , rather than their normal ice coffee has míchaný chai , another novinku . 
the rosenthal , another long-time zákazník , oddaně go into verbu since 2003 . 
the go ahead of work and objednává , not always the same . 
a quarter of a “ in and around eight every day , as přijdu watches , and are preparing for me , my housku , with the and with máslem , ” he said . 
foto : rodriguez said that he wanted to try something new and to add to the supply of new ingredients derived . 
ban rosenthal to continue to objednává what to do , but sometimes at their housku , with the left to some bacon inside , and šunku egg . 
rodriguez said that it is not líto that trade with the old mýdly zabral his place . 
it is true that owners soap cherie to offer but that for the verb vyrobí special mýdlo and as přísadu filtrovanou kávu use of the coffee shops . 
“ i think that we still could use , ” said rodriguez . 
the traditional polish people greenpointu kavárnu by well . 
one of the new consumers in the supply of přeložil polštiny and rodriguez that he wants to find a place where it soon , at its neighbors to the new felt as at home . 
instead of new has yet another benefits . 
local manufacturer ovocných šťáv wants to stáčet lahví and sell filtrovanou kávu . 
there are able to kavárna spread to neighboring buildings . 
many customers only to win back their old favorita . 
joseph whitt was pravidelným zákazníkem and when kavárna zavřela that he this zlomilo heart . 
ban whitt is that when again kavárna vejít opened , and make sure kávu is as come home . 
“ lack the vůně me , ” said . 
depresivní foods of the crisis , in the “ square meal ” 
soon after the nastoupení in the office of president in march 1933 sitting franklin delano roosevelt , in the oval office , and a obědval . 
president labužník roosevelt , pochutnával on goods collected from on avenue , as was paštička of husích jatýrek and marylandská želví polévka . 
his menu to this day , but it was more modest : egg ďábelský on the way in rajské omáčce , bramborové pyré and as dezert švestkový pudink . 
this was an act of “ kuchařské solidarity with those who suffered , ” she hit ziegelmanová . 
its a husband ’ s andrew coe added : “ it was also the message to the americans , as they eat . ” 
a few , who live in brooklyn heights , has been devoted to gastronomické history . 
the book ’ s andrew coea “ chop suey ” was about china ’ s kuchyni in america , while hit in his book “ 97 orchard ” tells the story of the lower house obytného east side through foods . 
their work , and a new “ square meal , ” which in úterý uveřejní harper , history is american kuchyně during the great depression . 
they have shown kuchařskou solidarity , and with reportérem met to have dinner in eisenbergově trade sendviči , a small strohém bufetu in neighborhoods flatiron , which is traffic since the crisis , since 1929 . 
hit ( 54 ) , and the objednala smetanový sýr sendvič sekanými olivami , andrew ( 57 ) , has krocana , bramborou mess and míchanou vegetables . 
the reportér objednal masový karbanátek , which , according to the couple výborně hodil to talk about jídle during the crisis . 
“ karbanátky were very popular , ” she slečna ziegelmanová . 
the burákový sold , and játrový fazolový karbanátek . 
to generate from any other příměsi and cheap food , which ingredienci nastavila . 
the amount of přestavte buráků that you would have had to have dinner sníst . 
the andrew coe ušklíbl . 
“ ležely would you in the stomach as lead , ” he said . 
in the years before the crisis , the us kuchyně , mostly in rural areas , in the form of a podávána bufetu sněz what sníš . 
teams of women vařily for workers from farms and to have dinner obědu breakfast , and the podával selama upečený pie . 
they were americans who posílal foods hladovějícím europeans during the first world war . “ and square meal ” is watching what ways of the nation vyrovnával with the that this was not suddenly hojnosti countries . 
it was “ a time when the foods has become a central , to the point that the american people , ” said the coe vysvětlenou why he and his wife decided about napsat . 
as obávanou was a new budget dieta : spilled záhadná food , as karbanátky and food from kastrůlků kastrůlek , as “ a great way to use what , ” scarred ziegelmanová , because kuchaři could neestetické ingredients derived disguised under tier krémové omáčky . 
fresh fruits was nahrazeno cheaper sušeným ovocem . 
meat - after long years of focal point in the us food , has become úsporně přidělovaným luxusem . 
a peculiar směsky that should serve as a kalorická and výživová výplň , have precedence over an appetite for or even at odds with both common sense to cook . 
during the polls for a book , which contains prescriptions , slečna ziegelmanová established dobové foods of pečené cibule plněné burákovým máslem . 
this was not popular “ increasing večerní on the table , ” said andrew coe . 
hit ziegelmanová emphasized : “ it was surrealistické . ” 
burákové máslo with pečenou cibulí is combined . 
this was a typical of domestic prescriptions . 
so , as never before , and never then domestic economists between them - louis stanley , šér federal office for the domestic economy , in 1923 1943 - to manage stravovací habits of the country . 
uveřejňovali prescriptions and articles in newspapers and journals , vyzývaly women to assume go budget , and šlichty , such as smetanové špagety with mrkví , přeměňovaly chutná on food . 
the book “ and square meal ” is celebrated historical pochoutek . 
above all , zákusky originated in the answers governments hladovým its citizens , such as president póza herberta hoovera “ dám the pie ” . 
while publicly chválil simple iowskou a farm kuchyni its childhood , stoloval as vybraný milionář , which became . 
“ likes to jedl continental kuchyni , such as fish with okurkovou omáčkou , ” said andrew coe . 
jedl in almost vyzlacené room , on its own , should smoking . 
he was immensely old-fashioned . 
president roosevelt would likely committed the same mistake , if it did not move eleanor his wife , he went to an example of their own žaludkem . 
as the book tells , paní rooseveltová najala hospodyni , which is no appetite for nezajímala . it has led to the fact that , “ the white house , not only podávalo almost this nejponurejší foods in the washington , but also by nejneutěšenějším ready way . ” 
many jídelních habits of the crisis cured immediately , as the country again walk on its feet . 
the legacy of remained constant in our research kalorií and výživových values , says slečna ziegelmanová , and in the way that the science aplikuje to cook . 
a few is that , in writing a book better understood stravovací habits mothers slečny ziegelmanové - why failed to be throwing foods . 
should the “ real fear of a waste of food , ” said andrew coe . 
ziegelmanová připoměla : “ people from it was wrong . ” 
there have been nehodě with věnečky . 
when they were in eisenberga clean stoly , and the ban coe vytáhli dezert that připravili at home : švestkový dezert that president roosevelt jedl to obědu . 
“ says he švestkový krém , ” she ziegelmanová and china that obvyklým trikem was giving skromným receptům elegant it words . 
there was no krém , only švestky , a bit mouky , the carrot , water , and skořice . 
every reluctantly zabořil lžičku into husté hnědé hmoty . 
surprisingly , it was bad . 
andrew coe to add , and then even one . 
as the right , and his wife hospodář said : “ hodilo would be a bit sekaných vlašáků . ”

callum skinner from scotland stepping into yesterday at night síně into the decline in mužském týmovém sprintu on velodromu in rio , when trio team vb obhájilo degree of london 2012 . 
třiadvacetiletý rodák of glasgowa was in the role of the brakes , which took for their skot sir chris hoy , and man legendu potěšil when přiřítil to target and ukradl victory in the hands of favorizovaného new zealand . 
the uk four years ago , and won a hoy pátou gained from its six olympic golden medailí . 
and the same ploy to repeat the after the modest šestého on the world šampionátě in dráhové cyklistice in march , even when hoy , their careers ukončil . 
the problem between pekingem and londýnem was the replacement for specialized úvodního závodníka jamieho staffa . 
so it is hindes appeared in time . 
leaving hoye also have eased instead , which he filled kian emadi and matt crampton . 
skinner was a man of british trenérů and the search for the potential is now potvrdilo . 
kenny hindes - who was , together with the hoyem šampiónem four years ago - and the skinnerem reaching the olympic record in skills , but trikot ’ in the first round of the new zealand . 
and british trio gained in týmovém sprintu gold . 
hindes was after its round of slightly behind , but kenny team protlačil ahead and skinner leadership have maintained . 
the change strategy was much of transformation , when hindes jel to higher entrusting to slow and to kennymu and partly skinnerovi to maintain the pace . 
hoy závod follow from their position kolumnis and the bbc , when skinner kenny and hindes have pódium nespustil , in the eyes of them . 
třiadvacetiletý skinner , rodák of glasgowa , he said , “ it lichotivé comparison . ” 
i was there to themselves came from the best and do honor its name . 
we have created a olympic record in finále porazili , and we are the best . 
this was just unbelievable . 
there is no better way to win it . 
after the triumph of alongside kennyho and hoye in london in 2012 hindes admitted that schválně after slabém for start has fallen on a path . 
year later from back and opponents britain had no option recall . 
this time around the victory to no problem that it did not . 
hindes said : “ all those on the british flags tribunách , i připadal as in london . ” 
in the last three months we all as team semkli . 
we lost in many of the world ’ s závodech , so to win the olympics is just the amazing . 
this is one event , the golden medaile for one nation , which won tujuh dari sepuluh soutěží in beijing , and in london . 
if it is to be indicator of progress over the past five months , then the us on a successful velodromu five days . 
with form , which kenny shown , it is not inconceivable that would reiterated hoyův success and won three to one olympiádě gold medaile simultaneously . 
this would then for kennyho - which is precisely the day in the 12 years younger than hoy , has also narozeniny march 23 ( this date seems to be for uk sport sacrosanct in the day slaví narozeniny also steve redgrave , and mo farah roger bannister ) , has a golden six and one stříbrnou medaili . 
just how much gained hoy . 
as the other kenny will involve sprintu , which is now , and it will take another three days . 
osmadvacetiletý rodák of boltonu said : “ now they užívám tuhle . 
týmový závod is always best . 
vyhráváte , together with the other . 
he was right to win himself is a bit osamělé . 
hindes said : “ if the two win more gold medaile should be rytířský degree . ” 
this was the only medailový závod of the day , but the uk expected even more good news . 
sir bradley wiggins , ed clancy , and steven burke owain doull , kvalifikovali as as quickly as possible to stíhacího závodu družstev to four kilometry . 
skončili with 3 : 51.943 over time . 
the world ’ s record , which padl in london in 2012 , is 3 : 51.659 . 
the first round of and finále ( 22 : 42 ) is in today ’ s second , závodu , to which it certainly will focus wiggins . 
yesterday before kvalifikačním závodem debatoval with commissioners , when it judges called for změření výšky . 
in obdobném závodě women , which continues to end tomorrow , and reached laura trottová , joanna rowsell shandová , elinor barkerová and katie archibald milngavie of the world ’ s record : 13.260 4 with over time . 
the team vb spolehl on its strong team dráhové cyklistiky and ovládl the middle of the olympic games , and has a lot of medailí . 
indeed , after the exceptional výkonech showing the ground in beijing , and in london , during the příprav at the rio expectations . 
on the dramatic events in the unfolded , not least withdraw technical director shane suttona in april , owing to the charge of sexismu and discrimination , and an end to merge the competing career , such as hoy or victoria pendletonová . 
but , as the first night , on velodromu , it seems that the legendary reputation , a team that the uk can themselves involved cutting-edge performance with perfektním načasováním , could reaffirm . 
in the future uncertain tavírny portlandu after the end of the agreement on dodávku energy 
the future of the portlandské tavírny aluminum in victorii - and job creation of workers - is uncertain , owing to plant , which enterprise zásobuje electricity and reported that the idea of one of owners tavírny treaty electricity supplies to end . is expected to all of the treaty will zkráceny electricity supplies . 
this is what step for the government state victoria earlier this year to that neprodlouží providing enterprise subsidies to keep going in . 
the strong dvacetileté subsidies expire in november . 
in the house ’ s alcoa portland may be at risk and 2000 jobs . 
in zavření may be at risk and 2000 jobs - direct and indirect . 
and , because tavírna production consumes around 10 % of the total produced in electricity victorii , can happen to the other lavinovitým outcomes . 
alcoa in 2014 zavřela tavírnu point henry last year , which led to zavření plants anglesea . 
tavírna society alcoa in portlandu is prodělečná , and it is zavření . 
this step follows několikaletých speculation about the future of the house ’ s originally , in response to a strong australian dollar and recently of prices for the output závodu . 
agl that large tavírně aluminum provides electricity from plants loy yang and valleys in latrobe valley , has said that is expected to any other three homeowners will also be decided to end the treaty . 
an owner závodu majority is a common enterprise companies alcoa and alumina , small commercial stakes holds the chinese society , and the japanese citic marubeni corp . 
“ agl expects portlandský závod will continue to work , in other words , so that vyzická demand for electricity from tavírny will continue , ” sdělila . 
agl put it , is that the so-called “ zajišťovací contracts , ” which should join the since november 2016 . 
contracts have 12měsíční výpovědní a , so their validity does end in 2017 . 
“ agl continue to assume that the will to participate in the gains for fiscal year 2017 , ” said the plant . 
any possible impact on profits from agl fiscal year 2018 further is currently limited to run a market for strong commodity wholesale electricity prices . 
agl initiated that already sepsala contracts , according to the value of their accounting books of $ 187 million dollars for “ the case that would have been to ukončoení . ” 
the company alcoa put it , the decision to end the “ no effect on its ability to secure the ... tavírnu or electricity supplies to tavírny . ” 
american society , to put it in 2010 to close the loy yang kontrakt for 20 years , which should have to pay since november of this year , and even when must explain why from the regressed . 
analysts are very careful , when it comes to be a portlandské tavírny in victorii and závodu tomago near the newcastlu as a result of a weak economy in industries . 
the leading traffic agl stehpen mikkelsen , which , at the beginning of this week turned on the analysts , said that the portland around $ 600 per year production consumes megawattů electricity and tomago around $ 900 megawattů . 
if the both of these enterprises withdrew from the market , it would mean a significant reduction of demand in the market [ electricity ] . 
for the us as the manufacturer would not good , ” he said . 
kendall is not only a result hvězdou real-estate show kardashianových - is now obálce september vogue 
kendall jennerová ( 20 modelka ) , and the fourth daughter matky-manažerky klanu kris kardashian-jennerová to a on september titulní stránce the american journal vogue . 
kendall , ambasadorka brands estee lauder that předváděla to fashion weeku milan did in new york , paris , and novinku announced in čtvrtek on its account for instagramu . 
“ in the room full people that miluji , i in view of the tuhle titulní side cry , ” he wrote kendall . 
the titulní strengths followed bizarre ( or simply continued humoresky in file kardashianových ? ) stage-managed video , in which it was a family kardashianových-jennerových ( baroví výtržníci rob and caitly and , together with them all popular strýček from šoubyznysu , producent keeping up ryan seacrest . ) on their obálku sisters forget , only to the scene could result in a classic pada : the cost secretive párty . 
this is obehraná dějová line almost every “ narozeninového ” board of television show ( seacrest pronáší : “ for , thought that we on you forget ? ” with upřímností kresleného králíka in the in eight hours i ) , but somehow kris needed to ensure that the other girls to téhle publicity could to fuel . 
because if we look at this september figure journal vogue , so we certainly has into a new era of kardashianových . 
older sister kim may kendall obálku in vogue dotlačila ( was on it together with its manželem kanye westem in april 2014 ) , but titulka september extradition to the league is different . 
this september the journal vogue nejprodávanější is the number of the year . 
the that its tloušťkou resembles a book for the purpose of advertising , rather than the fashionable attracts , a number of inzerentů ( fashionista napočítal that of 832 parties in the last year was 615 parties with reklamním content ) . 
the stars that appears on titulní stránce is nedočkavě očekáváno , so it is no surprise that in the past two years , snímky journal unikly before his official uveřejněním . 
among women , which in the past , the obálce there are naomi campbell , linda evandelista or kate moss . 
in recent years , the titulní stránce occurred is more “ celebrities , which are modelky ” than the “ modelek , which are celebritami . ” 
jennifer lawrence , držitelka oscara and ambasadorka brands dior , to titulce appeared in 2013 , a year later have the honor lagy gaga . 
but even when it is very unlikely that kendall - which magazín described as “ průlomovou modelku ” its generation , falling out in the first category , will be in a very good society . 
these are related to known celebrities people , or stars property , or the children of today ’ s show that they know how to do well sestříhané video ( even if jennerová is all this ) . 
these are prokazatelně talented women , which stand out in entertainment industry . 
that is embodied in the titulní stránce emerged last year , was one of the strongest years in their kariéře by the alba lemonade . 
of course , not every is of success jennerové enthusiastic about . 
its position in the world , will always be difficult to its participation in reality show . 
stephanie seymorová , the original modelka victoria , with the secret in june criticized jennerovou and its kolegyni gigi hadidovou and nazvala is “ děvkami moment . ” 
these sentiments again rozhořely the news about the jennerová appear to obálce vogue . 
but this discontent is misplaced . 
kendall jennerová is on september obálce vogue . 
this is supermodelka in pravém sense . 
for has flaunted mark jacobse . 
you sold make up from estee lauder . 
the and all of her sisters you snímky sell themselves themselves on their own paywallech . 
sold fotky daughters do cindy crawfordové that nafotila for magazín love . 
and in the free moments účinkuje in reality show , perhaps only as one of the ways to see kourtney and its children .

people who escape from relations with násilníkem , people with excessive debt , and disabling families procházející odloučením , workers who are unjustly dismissed - all of these people have problems with právními dimensions , and this report , shows that have no chance to win the help that they need . 
the federal government since june 2017 will reduce the funding of about 30 % , leading to another , that thousands of people from queenslandu will have to zorientovat in the complex legal problems without assistance . 
urge state representatives and senator george queenslandu brandise to immediately zabránili this contractions in finance , to people ’ s assistance that they need , when they got into the legal problems .

the uk must continue to spread the spirit of the olympic and expanzovat heathrow 
heathrow will also source of renewal and prosperity , not only for our local communities and across londýnem , but in the country . 
for me is a huge heathrow attractive , just as was london 2012 , when we developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to benefit from the olympic games . 
the olympic games mean a huge benefits for startford and east end . 
and we we do that , once again , so that opportunities for local vytvoříme people and firms in the near heathrow . 
only for our local communities vytvoříme 10,000 výučních new jobs , 40 dan new jobs and end youth unemployment in around airport . 
just as the london ’ s olympiádou in 2012 , and there will find some who will to think that the heathrow is too big . 
i was told that britain never be ready to the olympic games , and that the world pódiu zesměšníme . 
pochybovači the wrong in 2012 , and , in the case of heathrow , not that they will be right . 
always will need to be zdolávat obstacles , but heathrow can zodpovědět every question that it concerns . 
as the olympic games , is heathrow project infrastructure , to which the accounts for many people and companies , nejenom only a few . 
the is an opportunity to create a 180 dan new jobs , economic growth by 211 billion , to £ zanechání legacy of skills and job as around airports and in the united kingdom . 
we have to heathrow excellent team that the term and set down budget , investment in infrastructure program for 11 billion £ , starting with terminálem t5 - which he was elected on the best terminálem world five years in a row , after terminál t2 , who was built between two nejrušnějšími ranvejemi in the world . 
now they are prepared to provide a third ranvej , which accounts for 16 billion £ private investment . 
the game in london in 2012 , great success of the united kingdom , and i believe that the heathrow it will also . 
it is time to continue šířili the spirit of the olympic games and rozšířili heathrow , in order to trading in the future , and abandoned their legacy of skills and employment , which can be britain proud .

menurut nasa climate model : venuše was once obyvatelná 
according to a new projekcí nasa climate model was once venuše obyvatelná . 
researchers in goddardově nasa institute for the study of the universe developed model for research venuše using tools and algorithms similar to those that use the study climate scientists working . 
the pattern was navržen to identify , whether once in venuši , which is emerging horký , without water and prosycená co2 , they could panovat conditions such conditions in the country . 
researchers already proposed before that low gear otáčení venuše can be explained by their hustou the atmosphere . 
according to the newest simulations , it seems that the venuše once could řídkou atmosphere in a country , and the otáčela slowly . 
model is also zabýval earlier topografií venuše . 
on the planet is likely to be the sušší than in the country , but it used to be enough water and geographic diversity to rule on it life and providing protection against rapid odpařování . 
venuše previously also used the sun , which was about 30 % tlumenější . 
in the “ simulaci model giss venuše during the slow otáčení to it its day party to the sun almost two months suddenly , ” explained scholar of giss anthony del genio in a new report . 
this is to the surface ohřívání and the creation of the rain , which creates hustou tier cloud formation , which are as deštník and emerging zaštiťují a little wonder solar teplem . 
the result is the climate , with an average temperatures , which are in fact slightly lower than currently in the country . 
the draft a story venuše similar to the evolution of the , which previously hypoteticky sestavili planetary scientists . 
even when was venuše in the past , probably obyvatelná -- over the years , several billion -- were exposed přílišnému heat and ultrafialovému x-ray . 
its oceans are odpařily and water vapor were , the light spáleny . 
a hydrogen and zbyla only hustá atmosphere of carbon dioxide the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- is venuše , as we know it now . 
researchers their results from the new climate model venuše uveřejnili in the geophysical research letters .

kepler measured speed otáčení stars in plejádách 
the latest mission keplerova teleskopu space to help astronomům is almost a list of the speed of the stars kompletního otáčení hvězdokupy plejády . 
new data astronomům helps to understand why stars in hvězdokupě to various rychlostmi , and also as a otáčení related to the zformováním planet . 
“ we hope that porovnáním our results with other hvězdokupami , dozvíme more about the relationship between star hmotou , and even its stářím history in its solar system ” put it in a new report luisa rebullová , research pracovnice at the center of the caltech , with infrared processing and analysis centers in pasadeně . 
hvězdokupa plejády is 445 lighting years since the country . 
many of the stars in an accumulation is now stands at the state of the maturity and were about more than 125 milióny years . 
now the fastest otáčí . 
in moments their highest peaks speed these otáčení dospívající stars releasing huge amounts of hvězdného wind . 
because these winds range along magnetic fields stars have slowing effect on them . 
along with the as hvězda aging , slowing , and its speed otáčení . 
kepler measured speed otáčení every stars so that measured time between objevením rozeznatelných points to hvězdách -- such slunečním skvrnám . 
according to the newest data about rychlostech otáčení more stars otáčejí more slowly than less massive stars . 
rebullová compares actors to do more , tanečníkům piruety more slowly than those less . 
“ in the “ baletu ” plejád , we can now see that more slowly , točící stars are masivnější , while those that have to its , they are typically quite simple stars , ” she rebullová . 
because it is hvězdokupa plejád , so close to serve as an ideal kosmická lab for comparing the quality of the stars and speed otáčení . 
“ plejády provide us with kotvu for theoretical models hvězdné rotace in both ways , under the age of for the elderly , and star movement , ” she rebullová . 
there is still a lot of what we know about how , when , and why stars slowing their otáčení speed and so říkajíc “ pověsí their dance boty on hřebíček . ” 
rebullová and her colleagues details have written the latest analysis speed otáčení plejád in three studiích , which will soon uveřejněny in the journal astronomical . 
kvalifikační agreement is needed ? 
if i nepřihlásila , it would be so kvalifikační agreement neuzavírala and after several months , i could switch to other hospital ? 
is it even possible after dostudování work without přihlášení into specializačního education ? 
it is a me that in the field , in which i wanted to work , is now free jobs in a somewhat vzdálenější hospital , but in roughly half of the year could unlock rather than in other , where i would then to worked . 
the council , so i don ’ t know how to address the situation roughly půlrok , continues dotaz . 
to mgr. lenka vlková . 
no legal regulation nestanoví duty to deal with the kvalifikační zaměstnavatelem - nemocnicí . 
kvalifikační agreement is legal institute , which establishes codes work , and can be reached between wage and zaměstnavatelem in order to ensure the return of the costs of the vynaložených increases or prohlubováním skills workers . 
in health care is the vyvíjen long-term pressure on neuzavírání these agreements with a view to ensuring labor mobility health-care workers and not all , of the hospital currently the agreement require . 
according to the law reinforce 95 / 2004 , winning a conditions . the bank ’ s recognition and professional qualifications and specialized ’ capacity to the health of doctors , zubního doctors and farmaceuta explicitly , it is true that participation in specializačním education is considered deepening skills ( not to increase its ) . 
this means that kvalifikační agreement to be reached code can work only if the costs are at 75,000 kč . 
no legal prescription or nestanoví duty to embrace the specializačního education . 
the only on the conditions for inclusion in the field specializačního education . 
it is a doctor but , according to the law of a doctor who authorized to carry out the needed absolvování college , even when a set of conditions ( under professional supervision doctors have specialized způsobilostí příslušném in the field ) . 
the law by dividing the situation , which can be into specializačního education doctor započítána odborná practice absolvovaná in another field specialties if its and the content to příslušnému vzdělávacímu program . 
in theory , would be possible for započítat odpracovanou elsewhere , which would higher tazatelčině situation . 
nevertheless , to the extent that neznám closer to the circumstances of the case , can be recommend consultation with the move toward meeting odborem health ministry ( odbor science and medical of ) , because the health of the law provides consulting and konzultační service associated with zařazením into specializačního education and with its průběhem . 
consulting service , are now also provides the czech medical chamber , which must be a member of a doctor .
